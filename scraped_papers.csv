carbonate. Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which
are columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of
nanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells
collected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved
and particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea
shells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly
microspheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments
were conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into
the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of
drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in
drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent
ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro
drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM
images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The
sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be
useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and
39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)
was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was
released slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic
polymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a
potential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages."

pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Many existing computational
drug repurposing methods rely on preclinical data (e.g., chemical structures,
drug targets), resulting in translational problems for clinical trials. In this
study, we propose a clinical connectivity map framework for drug repurposing by
leveraging laboratory tests to analyze complementarity between drugs and
diseases. We establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory test
associations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a
longitudinal electronic health record data. We establish clinical disease sign
vectors (i.e., disease-laboratory test associations) by applying a Wilcoxon
rank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Finally, we compute a
repurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair by applying a dot
product-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical
drug effect vectors. We comprehensively evaluate 392 drugs for 6 important
chronic diseases (e.g., asthma, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.).
We discover not only known associations between diseases and drugs but also
many hidden drug-disease associations. Moreover, we are able to explain the
predicted drug-disease associations via the corresponding complementarity
between laboratory tests of drug effect vectors and disease sign vectors. The
proposed clinical connectivity map framework uses laboratory tests from
electronic clinical information to bridge drugs and diseases, which is
explainable and has better translational power than existing computational
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework and suggest that our method could help identify drug repurposing
opportunities, which will benefit patients by offering more effective and safer
treatments."

biological and pharmacological data provide new ways to accelerate drug-target

low-dimensional features for drugs and target proteins by integrating four drug

interaction information between drug and target representations by a mutual
attention network to improve drug-target prediction. DrugMAN achieves the best
prediction performance under four different scenarios, especially in real-world

condition, is common in patients managing multiple or complex conditions.
However, as more drugs are added to the treatment plan, the risk of adverse

polypharmacy only become known after the drugs are in use. It is impractical to
test every possible drug combination during clinical trials. This issue is
particularly prevalent among older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
where polypharmacy and ADEs are commonly observed. In this research, our
primary objective was to identify key drug features to build and evaluate a

model on a domain-specific case study. We developed a two-layer neural network
that incorporated drug features such as molecular structure, drug-protein
interactions, and mono drug side effects (DrIVeNN). We assessed DrIVeNN using
publicly available side effect databases and determined Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) with a variance threshold of 0.95 as the most effective feature

Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH

With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased, and the side phase
fraction decreased. Using 1 H-13 C, 13 C-27 Al HETCOR NMR in combination with

understated. With the sheer volume of potentially useful compounds that are

investigate the overlapping interactions between drugs. Understanding this is
also important to the layperson who needs to know what they can and cannot mix,
especially for those who use recreational drugs - which do not have the same
rigorous warnings as prescription drugs. Without access to deterministic,
experimental results for every drug combination, other methods are necessary to
bridge this knowledge gap. Ideally, such a method would require minimal inputs,

model that meets all these criteria. To this end, we propose a minimal-input
multi-layer perceptron that predicts the interactions between two drugs. This
model has a great advantage of requiring no structural knowledge of the

multi-relational drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Typically, most existing
methods begin by constructing a multi-relational DDI graph and then learning
relation-aware graph structure embeddings (RaGSEs) of drugs from the DDI graph.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches are usually limited in learning RaGSEs
of new drugs, leading to serious over-fitting when the test DDIs involve such
drugs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel DDI prediction method based
on relation-aware graph structure embedding with co-contrastive learning,
RaGSECo. The proposed RaGSECo constructs two heterogeneous drug graphs: a
multi-relational DDI graph and a multi-attribute drug-drug similarity (DDS)
graph. The two graphs are used respectively for learning and propagating the
RaGSEs of drugs, aiming to ensure all drugs, including new ones, can possess
effective RaGSEs. Additionally, we present a novel co-contrastive learning
module to learn drug-pairs (DPs) representations. This mechanism learns DP
representations from two distinct views (interaction and similarity views) and
encourages these views to supervise each other collaboratively to obtain more
discriminative DP representations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our RaGSECo
on three different tasks using two real datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that RaGSECo outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction

pharmaceutical research. Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new
disease indications with increasing success. As polypharmacology, defined a
drug's ability to bind to several targets but due to possible side effects,
this feature is not taken into consideration. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry
focused on the development of highly selective single-target drugs. Nowadays
after lot of researches, it is clear that polypharmacology is important for the
efficacy of drugs. There are side effects but on the other hand, this gives the
opportunity to uncover new uses for already known drugs and especially for
complex diseases. Thus, it is clear that there are two sides of the same coin.
There are several approaches to discover new drugs targets, as analysis of
genome wide association, gene expression data and networks, structural
approaches with alignment methods etc. Computational drug discovery and design
has experienced a rapid increase in development which is mainly due to the
increasing cost for discovering new compounds. Since drug development is a very
costly venture, the pharmaceutical industry puts effort in the repositioning of
withdrawn or already approved drugs. The costs for bringing such a drug to
market are 60% lower than the development of a novel drug, which costs roughly
one billion US dollars. Thus, target prediction, drug repositioning approaches,
protein-ligand docking and scoring algorithms, virtual screening and other
computational techniques have gained the interest of researchers and

from the L1000 project, which provides information on the upregulation and
downregulation of genes caused by selected drugs. This chemical perturbation
information is processed, and a compact dataset is prepared, serving as the
functional feature set of the drugs. By integrating the drug, gene, and target

magnetic Zn0.3Fe0.6O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method in
the presence of citric acid as a reducing agent. In order to reduce the amount
of impurity and obtain the pure spinel phase and reduce the size of magnetic
nanoparticles, the hydrothermal process was carried out in the presence of
different concentrations of the reducing agent and pH level of the medium. The
structural investigations of the resulting nanoparticles were carried out by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results
showed that in order to obtain pure and single-phase spinel nanoparticles with
appropriate particle size and size distribution, it is necessary to control the
concentration of reducing agent and pH."

choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based

expand by killing other cells. Novel cytotoxic drugs and molecularly targeted
drugs are commonly administered as part of cancer therapy. Both types of drugs

The model incorporates resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted drugs. In both
cases, the level of drug resistance is assumed to be a continuous variable
ranging from fully-sensitive to fully-resistant. Using our model we demonstrate
that when the competition is moderate, therapies using both drugs are more
effective compared with single drug therapies. However, when cancer cells are

therapies that are initiated with a targeted drug and are exposed to it for a

utilized this temporal dimension. In these studies, the gene expression data is
either considered at one time-point (before the administration of the drug) or
two timepoints (before and after the administration of the drug). This is
clearly inadequate in modeling dynamic gene-drug interactions, especially for
applications such as long-term drug therapy.
  In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for

exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past
values of drug responses for subsequent predictions. It also incorporates
tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing
data, but also predict unseen gene expression levels (GELs). These advantages
enable REP to estimate drug response at any stage of a given treatment from
some GELs measured in the beginning of the treatment. Extensive experiments on

predictive performance can be improved by better modeling the interactions
between drug pairs with bilinear forms. However, the shallow models leveraging

Specifically, weighted snapshot sequences for dynamic heterogeneous networks

achieving comprehensive patient representations with both semantic features and

available to obtain high-quality medication combination recommendation.

existing computational approaches achieve inspiring results, they ignore that
the action of a drug is mainly caused by its chemical substructures. In
addition, their interpretability is still weak. Results: In this paper, by
supposing that the interactions between two given drugs are caused by their
local chemical structures (sub-structures) and their DDI types are determined
by the linkages between different substructure sets, we design a novel
Substructure-ware Tensor Neural Network model for DDI prediction (STNN-DDI).
The proposed model learns a 3-D tensor of (substructure, in-teraction type,
substructure) triplets, which characterizes a substructure-substructure
interaction (SSI) space. According to a list of predefined substructures with
specific chemical meanings, the mapping of drugs into this SSI space enables
STNN-DDI to perform the multiple-type DDI prediction in both transductive and
inductive scenarios in a unified form with an explicable manner. The
compar-ison with deep learning-based state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates
the superiority of STNN-DDI with the significant improvement of AUC, AUPR,
Accuracy, and Precision. More importantly, case studies illustrate its
interpretability by both revealing a crucial sub-structure pair across drugs
regarding a DDI type of interest and uncovering interaction type-specific
substructure pairs in a given DDI. In summary, STNN-DDI provides an effective

a multi-view graph where each node in the interaction graph itself is a drug

disease, drug, and protein. Analysis of the post-learning features showed that
node types that were not known to the model beforehand are distinguished

weights and features, GraphIX then predicts the disease-drug association and
calculates the contribution values of the nodes located in the neighborhood of
the predicted disease and drug. We hypothesized that the neighboring protein
node to which the model gave a high contribution is important in understanding
the actual pharmacological effects. Quantitative evaluation of the validity of
protein nodes' contribution using a real-world database showed that the high
contribution proteins shown by GraphIX are reasonable as a mechanism of drug

present to users new disease-drug associations and identify the protein

combinations by experiments since the vast number of possible combinations.
Currently, computational methods, especially graph neural networks and
transformer, have been developed to discover the prioritization of drug
combinations and shown promising potentials. Despite great achievements have
been obtained by existing computational models, they all neglected high-order
semantic information of drugs and the importance of the chemical bond features,
which contained rich information and is represented by edge of graphs in drug
predictions. In this work, we present a novel model named EGTSyn (Edge-based
Graph Transformer network for drug Synergy prediction) for anti-cancer drug
synergistic effect prediction. We design an EGNN (edge-based graph neural
network) module and a GTDblock (Graph Transformer for Drugs block). EGNN is
employed to capture the global structure information of the chemicals as well
as the importance of chemical bonds that has been neglected by most of the
previous studies. GTDblock combines the EGNN module with a

targets in cells, influencing target activities and subsequently impacting
biological pathways to promote healthy functions and treat diseases. Moving
beyond binary relationships and exploring tighter triple relationships is
essential to understanding drugs' mechanism of action (MoAs). Moreover,

inefficient due to stark time and monetary costs. In silico methods have become
increasingly important for screening drugs, but current methods are inaccurate
and generalize poorly to unseen anticancer drugs. In this paper, I employ a
geometric deep-learning model utilizing a graph attention network that is
equivariant to 3D rotations, translations, and reflections with structural

classify synergistic drug combinations specific to each cell line. I compared
the proposed geometric deep learning framework to current state-of-the-art

performance on all 12 benchmark tasks performed on the DrugComb dataset.
Specifically, the proposed framework outperformed other SOTA methods by an
accuracy difference greater than 28%. Based on these results, I believe that
the equivariant graph attention network's capability of learning geometric data
accounts for the large performance improvements. The model's ability to
generalize to foreign drugs is thought to be due to the structural motifs

paradigm for AD drug discovery. Among various methods for drug repurposing,
network-based methods have shown promising results as they are capable of
leveraging complex networks that integrate multiple interaction types, such as
protein-protein interactions, to more effectively identify candidate drugs.
However, existing approaches typically assume paths of the same length in the
network have equal importance in identifying the therapeutic effect of drugs.
Other domains have found that same length paths do not necessarily have the
same importance. Thus, relying on this assumption may be deleterious to drug
repurposing attempts. In this work, we propose MPI (Modeling Path Importance),
a novel network-based method for AD drug repurposing. MPI is unique in that it
prioritizes important paths via learned node embeddings, which can effectively
capture a network's rich structural information. Thus, leveraging learned
embeddings allows MPI to effectively differentiate the importance among paths.
We evaluate MPI against a commonly used baseline method that identifies anti-AD
drug candidates primarily based on the shortest paths between drugs and AD in
the network. We observe that among the top-50 ranked drugs, MPI prioritizes
20.0% more drugs with anti-AD evidence compared to the baseline. Finally, Cox
proportional-hazard models produced from insurance claims data aid us in
identifying the use of etodolac, nicotine, and BBB-crossing ACE-INHs as having
a reduced risk of AD, suggesting such drugs may be viable candidates for
repurposing and should be explored further in future studies."

bonding and chirality of a drug molecule have a great influence on the
pharmacological properties of the molecule, and these information are implied
in the chemical bonds formed by the edges between the atoms. In addition, CNN
methods for modelling cell lines genomics sequences can only perceive local
rather than global information about the sequence. In order to solve the above
problems, we propose the decoupled dual transformer structure with edge
embedded for drug respond prediction (TransEDRP), which is used for the
representation of cell line genomics and drug respectively. For the drug
branch, we encoded the chemical bond information within the molecule as the

availability has hindered computational methods' abilities to learn patterns
associated with effective drug-cell line pairs. In this work, we propose the
use of contrastive learning to improve learned drug and cell line
representations by preserving relationship structures associated with drug
mechanism of action and cell line cancer types. In addition to achieving
enhanced performance relative to a state-of-the-art method, we find that
classifiers using our learned representations exhibit a more balances reliance
on drug- and cell line-derived features when making predictions. This
facilitates more personalized drug prioritizations that are informed by signals
related to drug resistance."

challenges in drug manufacturing. Thus, understanding the process is critical
to efficiently adapting crystallization to biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
This article describes phase behavior for the solution crystallization of
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids of serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as
model biological macromolecular assemblies. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion
experiments are used to determine the combined effects of pH and polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride concentrations in which full and empty capsids
nucleate and grow. Full and empty capsids show different crystallization
behavior although they possess similar capsid structure and similar outer
morphology with icosahedral symmetry and 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry.
The differential charge environment surrounding full and empty capsids is found
to influence capsid crystallization. The crystal growth rate is found to be
affected by the mass of the macromolecular assembly rather than the
structure/shape of the macromolecular assembly. The regions of precipitant
concentrations and pH in which crystallization occurs are found to be different
for different rAAV serotypes and for full and empty capsids for each serotype.
Depending on the precipitant concentrations and the rAAV serotype, a variety of
complex crystal morphologies are formed and a variety of non-crystallization
outcomes such as unidentified dense solid-phase/opaque crystals and an
oil/dense phase is observed. The well-defined dense phase/oil is found to be
converted into a solid phase over a long period of time. Trends in the
crystallization of full and empty capsids between serotypes is observed to be
altered by the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMS) associated
with the massive macromolecular proteinaceous assembly."

The prediction of the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs is a
multivariate regression problem with high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-omics
data as input data and with potentially strong correlations between the outcome
variables which represent the sensitivity to the different drugs. We propose a
joint penalized regression approach with structured penalty terms which allow
us to utilize the correlation structure between drugs with group-lasso-type
penalties and at the same time address the heterogeneity between omics data
sources by introducing data-source-specific penalty factors to penalize
different data sources differently. By combining integrative penalty factors
(IPF) with tree-guided group lasso, we create the IPF-tree-lasso method. We
present a unified framework to transform more general IPF-type methods to the
original penalized method. Because the structured penalty terms have multiple
parameters, we demonstrate how the interval-search Efficient Parameter
Selection via Global Optimization (EPSGO) algorithm can be used to optimize
multiple penalty parameters efficiently. Simulation studies show that
IPF-tree-lasso can improve the prediction performance compared to other
lasso-type methods, in particular for heterogenous data sources. Finally, we
employ the new methods to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in

collisions of inner drops, as combined with self-consistent hydrodynamic

of ions with a thickness of a few nanometers) at the graphene/IL interface due
to the local potential difference which also controls the local conductivity.
This structure provides a memristive mechanism based on a dynamic p-n junction
formation along the channel. Motivated by this memristive behavior, graphene/IL
devices were assembled with the aim of demonstrating memristive behavior and
associative learning. This work investigates memristive properties of flexible

the mechanism of the protonation step depends on the R2 group of the drug
molecule. Our simulations show that allylic carbon protonation occurs in the
case of cephalexin drug molecule where Lys211 is the proton donor and the
proton transfer occurs via a water chain formed (only) at the ring-opened

Next, we utilize embeddings of each layer to computationally extract kernel

produced through the process of fermentation. The hydration characteristics
(and phase diagrams) of these biological amphiphiles are atypical (and thus
their capacity to form myelin) because unlike typical amphiphiles, their
molecular structure is characterized by two hydrophilic groups (sugar,
carboxylic acid) on both ends with a hydrophobic moiety in the middle. We
tested three different glycolipid molecules: C18:1 sophorolipids and
single-glucose C18:1 and C18:0 glucolipids, all in their nonacetylated acidic
form. Neither sophorolipids (too soluble) nor C18:0 glucolipids (too insoluble)
displayed myelin growth at room temperature (RT, 25 C). The glucolipid C18:1
(G-C18:1), on the other hand, showed dense myelin growth at RT below pH 7.0.
Examining their growth rates, we find that they display a linear L $\alpha$ t

distinctly different from the L $\alpha$ t^(1/2) dependence, characterizing
diffusive growth such as what occurs in more conventional phospholipids. These

perform gradient descent to calibrate the inverse solutions within a local

viscosity fluid dynamics with thermally induced phase separation. We show that
the fluid dynamics greatly alters the evolution and equilibria of the phase
separation problem. Notably, buoyancy plays a critical role in driving the ATPS

a tenfold speedup in particle formation. Neglecting fluid dynamics produces
incorrect minimum-energy droplet shapes. The model allows for optimization of
current manufacturing procedures for structured microparticles and improves
understanding of ATPS evolution in confined and flowing settings important in
biology and biotechnology."

intended for the growth inhibition of cancer cells; however, it is challenging
to detect the efficacy of such drugs in early stages of treatment. A unique
method to assess the impact of anti-cancerous drugs on cancerous cells/tissues
is to probe the nanoscale structural alterations. In this paper, we study the
effect of different anti-cancerous drugs on ovarian tumorigenic cells, using
their nanoscale structural alterations as a biomarker. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) imaging on thin cell sections is performed to obtain their
nanoscale structures. The degree of nanoscale structural alterations of
tumorigenic cells and anti-cancerous drug treated tumorigenic cells are
quantified by using the recently developed inverse participation ratio (IPR)
technique. Results show an increase in the degree of nanoscale fluctuations in
tumorigenic cells relative to non-tumorigenic cells; then a nearly reverse of
the degree of fluctuation of tumorigenic cells to that of non-tumorigenic

Results: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis

DeepLigBuilder+, a deep generative model for 3D molecules that combines

Besides producing 3D molecular structures, the model also proposes synthetic
pathways for generated molecules, which greatly assists the retro-synthetic

synthesizability constraint using a tree-based organization of purchasable
building blocks. This method enjoys high scalability and is compatible with
existing atom-based generative models. Additionally, for structure-based design
tasks, we developed an SE(3)-equivariant transformer conditioned on the shape

search. Using the ATP-binding pocket of BTK and the NAD+ binding pocket of
PHGDH for case studies, we demonstrate that DeepLigBuilder+ is capable of
enriching drug-like molecules with high predicted binding affinity and
desirable interaction modes while maintaining the synthesizability constraint.

integral role in drug repositioning: the discovery of new uses for existing
drugs. One popular method of drug repositioning is network-based DTI
prediction, which uses complex network theory to predict DTIs from a
drug-target network. Currently, most network-based DTI prediction is based on
machine learning methods such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) or Support
Vector Machines (SVM). These methods require additional information about the
characteristics of drugs, targets and DTIs, such as chemical structure, genome
sequence, binding types, causes of interactions, etc., and do not perform
satisfactorily when such information is unavailable. We propose a new,
alternative method for DTI prediction that makes use of only network topology
information attempting to solve this problem.
  Results: We compare our method for DTI prediction against the well-known RBM
approach. We show that when applied to the MATADOR database, our approach based
on node neighborhoods yield higher precision for high-ranking predictions than
RBM when no information regarding DTI types is available.
  Conclusion: This demonstrates that approaches purely based on network
topology provide a more suitable approach to DTI prediction in the many
real-life situations where little or no prior knowledge is available about the
characteristics of drugs, targets, or their interactions."

inhaled drugs is still challenging. To investigate this complex interplay, the
pulmonary processes can be integrated into mathematical models. However,
existing modeling attempts considerably simplify these processes or are not

mathematical framework based on physiologically-structured population equations

(4) PK differences between healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Finally,
to identify the most impactful optimization criteria for orally inhaled drugs,
we investigated the impact of input parameters on both pulmonary and systemic

transformer-based model, that generates small molecules for input protein
sequences. Although promising, it generates both chemically valid and invalid

in time-consuming and inefficient drug discovery. To address these issues, we
introduce DrugGen, an enhanced model based on the DrugGPT structure. DrugGen is
fine-tuned on approved drug-target interactions and optimized with proximal

Evaluation across multiple targets demonstrated that DrugGen achieves 100%

discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in
generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most
existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets
independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as
subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of
ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same
molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different.
Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets
in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS

propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph
to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs.
Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule

One such
approach adopts structural controllability, a theory for controlling a network
(the cell). Motivated to protect the cell from viral infections, we extended
this theory to total controllability and introduced a new concept of control
hubs. Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by
exogenous stimuli, e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug
targets. We developed an efficient algorithm for finding all control hubs and
applied it to the largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction network.
Our new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including
that based on structural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs
are enriched with functions of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and
responses to cellular stress and nutrient levels, revealing critical pathways
induced by SARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to drugs in 4 major
categories: antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve
systems, and dietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their
functions also provided deep insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of the
drugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable drug
repurposing method. A remarkable example is Fostamatinib that has been shown to
lower mortality, shorten the length of ICU stay, and reduce disease severity of
hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The drug targets 10 control hubs, 9 of which
are kinases that play key roles in cell differentiation and programmed death.
One such kinase is RIPK1 that directly interacts with viral protein nsp12, the

discovery of drug candidates has attracted extraordinary attention, and many
deep generative models have been developed for automated drug design, termed
molecular generation. In general, molecular generation encompasses two main
strategies: de novo design, which generates novel molecular structures from
scratch, and lead optimization, which refines existing molecules into drug
candidates. Among them, lead optimization plays an important role in real-world
drug design. For example, it can enable the development of me-better drugs that
are chemically distinct yet more effective than the original drugs. It can also
facilitate fragment-based drug design, transforming virtual-screened small
ligands with low affinity into first-in-class medicines. Despite its
importance, automated lead optimization remains underexplored compared to the
well-established de novo generative models, due to its reliance on complex
biological and chemical knowledge. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
review of traditional computational methods for lead optimization, organizing
these strategies into four principal sub-tasks with defined inputs and outputs.
This review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD
techniques, and recent advancements in AIDD. Additionally, we introduce a
unified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the
methodologies of de novo design and lead optimization. Through this lens, de
novo design can incorporate strategies from lead optimization to address the
challenge of generating hard-to-synthesize molecules; inversely, lead
optimization can benefit from the innovations in de novo design by approaching
it as a task of generating molecules conditioned on certain substructures."

High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of

relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various
computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on
genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs
to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary
approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of
cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on
both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the
considered drugs. Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation and
an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64

Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of

curative dose of an antimalarial medication is administered to vulnerable
asymptomatic individuals at specified intervals, has been shown to have a
positive impact on reducing malaria transmission and deaths in children and
pregnant women. However, it can also promote drug resistance spread. Our
mathematical model is used to explore IPT effects on drug resistance in
holoendemic malaria regions while quantifying the benefits in deaths averted.
Our model includes both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of the
parasite as well as interactions between human hosts and mosquitoes. The basic
reproduction numbers for both strains as well as the invasion reproduction
numbers are derived and used to examine the role of IPT on drug resistance.
Numerical simulations show the individual and combined effects of IPT and
treatment of symptomatic infections on the prevalence levels of both parasite
strains and on the number of lives saved. The results suggest that while IPT
can indeed save lives, particularly in the high transmission region, certain
combinations of drugs used for IPT and drugs used to treat symptomatic
infection may result in more deaths when resistant parasite strains are
circulating. Moreover, the half-lives of the treatment and IPT drugs used play
an important role in the extent to which IPT may influence the rate of spread
of the resistant strain. A sensitivity analysis indicates the model outcomes
are most sensitive to the reduction factor of transmission for the resistant
strain, rate of immunity loss, and the clearance rate of sensitive infections."

The increase in the affinity data available in DT knowledge-bases allows the

predict DT interaction binding affinities. The few studies that focus on DT
binding affinity prediction use either 3D structures of protein-ligand

the modeling of protein sequences and compound 1D representations with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that the proposed deep
learning based model that uses the 1D representations of targets and drugs is
an effective approach for drug target binding affinity prediction. The model in

high-dimensional multi-omics data. We propose a multivariate Bayesian
structured variable selection model for sparse identification of omics features

drugs are designed for specific molecular targets, our approach makes use of
known structure between responses and predictors, e.g. molecular pathways and
related omics features targeted by specific drugs, via a Markov random field
(MRF) prior for the latent indicator variables of the coefficients in sparse
seemingly unrelated regression. The structure information included in the MRF
prior can improve the model performance, i.e. variable selection and response
prediction, compared to other common priors. In addition, we employ random
effects to capture heterogeneity between cancer types in a pan-cancer setting.
The proposed approach is validated by simulation studies and applied to the

properties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental
data for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor
system, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the
solutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep
learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the
solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate
novel drugs that can activate {\mu} opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood
brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated
180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000

literature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of
drug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a
novel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as
pharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug
repositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific
evidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge
graph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes
derived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that
exhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in
the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed
biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information.
Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of
the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with
target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our
case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility,
while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge
the gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in
drug repositioning research."

pharmaceutical development. The deep learning model achieves more accurate
results in DTI prediction due to its ability to extract robust and expressive
features from drug and target chemical structures. However, existing deep
learning methods typically generate drug features via aggregating molecular
atom representations, ignoring the chemical properties carried by motifs, i.e.,
substructures of the molecular graph. The atom-drug double-level molecular
representation learning can not fully exploit structure information and fails
to interpret the DTI mechanism from the motif perspective. In addition,
sequential model-based target feature extraction either fuses limited
contextual information or requires expensive computational resources. To tackle
the above issues, we propose a hierarchical graph representation learning-based
DTI prediction method (HiGraphDTI). Specifically, HiGraphDTI learns
hierarchical drug representations from triple-level molecular graphs to
thoroughly exploit chemical information embedded in atoms, motifs, and
molecules. Then, an attentional feature fusion module incorporates information
from different receptive fields to extract expressive target features.Last, the
hierarchical attention mechanism identifies crucial molecular segments, which
offers complementary views for interpreting interaction mechanisms. The
experiment results not only demonstrate the superiority of HiGraphDTI to the
state-of-the-art methods, but also confirm the practical ability of our model

this problem is to use a group of robots as a system. Thus, we focus on tasks
that can be achieved using a group of small-scale robots. These robots are
typically externally actuated due to their size limitation. Yet, one faces the
challenge of controlling a group of robots using a single global input. We
propose a control algorithm to position individual members of a swarm in
predefined positions. A single control input applies to the system and moves
all robots in the same direction. We also add another control modality by using
different length robots. An electromagnetic coil system applied external force
and steered the millirobots. This millirobot can move in various modes of
motion such as pivot walking and tumbling. We propose two new designs of these
millirobots. In the first design, the magnets are placed at the center of body
to reduce the magnetic attraction force. In the second design, the millirobots
are of identical length with two extra legs acting as the pivot points. This
way we vary pivot separation in design to take advantage of variable speed in
pivot walking mode while keeping the speed constant in tumbling mode. This
paper presents a general algorithm for positional control of n millirobots with
different lengths to move them from given initial positions to final desired
ones. This method is based on choosing a leader that is fully controllable.

accurate predictions of new remedies, which are often enzyme inhibitors,
require a clear understanding of the nature and function of the key players
governing the interaction between the drug candidate and its target. Here, we
propose to calculate electric fields to explicitly link structure to function
in molecular dynamics simulations, a method that can easily be integrated
within the rational drug discovery workflow. By projecting the electric fields
onto specific bonds, we can identify the system components that are at the
origin of stabilizing intermolecular interactions (covalent and non-covalent)
in the active site. This helps to significantly narrow the exploration space
when predicting new inhibitors. To illustrate this method, we characterize the
binding of the non-covalent inhibitor X77 to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a
particularly time-sensitive drug discovery problem. With electric field
calculations, we were able to identify 3 key residues (Asn-142, Met-165 and
Glu-166), that have functional consequences on X77. This contrasts with the
nearly 20 residues reported in previous studies as being in close contact with
inhibitors in the active site of the protease. As a result, the search for new
non-covalent inhibitors can now be accelerated by techniques that look to
optimize the interaction between candidate molecules and these residues."

Research (CDER) approvals from 1939 to 2019 as the data source, it is
demonstrated that the CHE has a distinct S-shaped structure demarcated by an
8-year (1939-1947) Stagnation Period, a 27-year (1947-1974) Emergent

dominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified during
the most recent 45-year CHE Saturation Period at 17, 8 and 4 years; thus, US
drug approvals have been following a Juglar-Kuznet mid-term cycle with
Kitchin-like bursts. As discussed, this work suggests that (1) changes in
extrinsic factors (e.g., of economic and/or policy origin ) during the Emergent

Non-additive Asakura-Oosawa (NAO) theory and a lattice theory in statistical

the knowledges, we propose two strategies to increase the delivery rate of
capsule shaped anti-cancer drugs to cancer cells. We consider that enhanced
repulsion between the normal cell and the drug accelerates the attraction
between the cancer cell and the drug, which can be named enhanced repulsion and
accelerated adsorption (ERAA) effect. To realize the ERAA effect, we propose a
supporting method for measuring the interactions using OT and AFM. In the
second strategy, dose of water-soluble polymers is considered to realize
adsorptions of the drugs and cancer cell derived exosomes onto the cancer
cells, which we call non-specific and selective adsorption (NSSA) effect. In

known active molecules to find further promising molecules for subsequent
screening. However, typically only very few active molecules are known.
Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the
effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We
introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich
a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference
molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to
associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large
set of reference (context) molecules through a Modern Hopfield Network.
Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would
associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known.
The enrichment step reinforces and amplifies the covariance structure of the
data, while simultaneously removing spurious correlations arising from the
decoration of molecules. Our approach is compared with other few-shot methods
for drug discovery on the FS-Mol benchmark dataset. On FS-Mol, our approach
outperforms all compared methods and therefore sets a new state-of-the art for
few-shot learning in drug discovery. An ablation study shows that the
enrichment step of our method is the key to improve the predictive quality. In
a domain shift experiment, we further demonstrate the robustness of our method.

Meanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features

positions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher

Existing experimental methods are time-consuming and rely on limited structural
and domain information. While learning-based methods can model sequence and
structural information, they struggle to integrate contextual data and often
lack comprehensive modeling of drug-target interactions. In this study, we
propose a novel DTA prediction method, termed HGTDP-DTA, which utilizes dynamic
prompts within a hybrid Graph-Transformer framework. Our method generates
context-specific prompts for each drug-target pair, enhancing the model's
ability to capture unique interactions. The introduction of prompt tuning
further optimizes the prediction process by filtering out irrelevant noise and
emphasizing task-relevant information, dynamically adjusting the input features
of the molecular graph. The proposed hybrid Graph-Transformer architecture
combines structural information from Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with
sequence information captured by Transformers, facilitating the interaction
between global and local information. Additionally, we adopted the multi-view
feature fusion method to project molecular graph views and affinity subgraph
views into a common feature space, effectively combining structural and
contextual information. Experiments on two widely used public datasets, Davis

drug discovery and development by predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs).
However, structure-based methods like molecular docking are too slow to allow
for broad proteome-scale screens, limiting their application in screening for
off-target effects or new molecular mechanisms. Recently, vector-based methods
using protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as a complementary approach
that bypasses explicit 3D structure modeling. Here, we develop SPRINT, a
vector-based approach for screening entire chemical libraries against whole
proteomes for DTIs and novel mechanisms of action. SPRINT improves on prior
work by using a self-attention based architecture and structure-aware PLMs to
learn drug-target co-embeddings for binder prediction, search, and retrieval.
SPRINT achieves SOTA enrichment factors in virtual screening on LIT-PCBA, DTI
classification benchmarks, and binding affinity prediction benchmarks, while
providing interpretability in the form of residue-level attention maps. In
addition to being both accurate and interpretable, SPRINT is ultra-fast:
querying the whole human proteome against the ENAMINE Real Database (6.7B
drugs) for the 100 most likely binders per protein takes 16 minutes. SPRINT
promises to enable virtual screening at an unprecedented scale, opening up new
opportunities for in silico drug repurposing and development. SPRINT is

spatially structured populations where all demes (i.e., subpopulations) are

that spatial structure can facilitate the survival of a bacterial population to
antibiotic treatment, starting from a sensitive inoculum. Specifically, the
bacterial population can be rescued if antibiotic resistant mutants appear and
are present when drug is added, and spatial structure can impact the fate of
these mutants and the probability that they are present. Indeed, the
probability of fixation of neutral or deleterious mutations providing drug
resistance is increased in smaller populations. This promotes local fixation of
resistant mutants in the structured population, which facilitates evolutionary
rescue by drug resistance in the rare mutation regime. Once the population is
rescued by resistance, migrations allow resistant mutants to spread in all

(OS) benefit for an experimental drug or treatment regimen (experimental group)
is often unobservable if some patients in the control group switch to drugs in
the experimental group and/or other cancer treatments after disease
progression. A key question often raised by payers and reimbursement agencies
is how to estimate the true benefit of the experimental drug group on overall
survival that would have been estimated if there were no treatment switches.
Several commonly used statistical methods are available to estimate overall
survival benefit while adjusting for treatment switching, ranging from naive
exclusion or censoring approaches to more advanced methods including inverse
probability of censoring weighting (IPCW), iterative parameter estimation (IPE)
algorithm or rank-preserving structural failure time models (RPSFTM). However,
many clinical trials now have patients switching to different treatment
regimens other than the test drugs, and the existing methods cannot handle more
complicated scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose two additional
methods: stratified RPSFTM and random-forest-based prediction. A simulation
study is conducted to assess the properties of the existing methods along with
the two newly proposed approaches."

drug discovery. This trend is unsurprising given the increasing volume of
relevant experimental data and the continuous improvement of ML algorithms.
However, conventional models, which rely on the principle of molecular
similarity, often fail to capture the complexities of chemical interactions,
particularly those involving activity cliffs (ACs) - compounds that are
structurally similar but exhibit evidently different activity behaviors. In
this work, we address two distinct yet related tasks: (1) activity cliff (AC)
prediction and (2) drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. Leveraging
insights gained from the AC prediction task, we aim to improve the performance
of DTI prediction through transfer learning. A universal model was developed
for AC prediction, capable of identifying activity cliffs across diverse
targets. Insights from this model were then incorporated into DTI prediction,
enabling better handling of challenging cases involving ACs while maintaining
similar overall performance. This approach establishes a strong foundation for
integrating AC awareness into predictive models for drug discovery. Scientific
Contribution This study presents a novel approach that applies transfer
learning from AC prediction to enhance DTI prediction, addressing limitations
of traditional similarity-based models. By introducing AC-awareness, we improve
DTI model performance in structurally complex regions, demonstrating the
benefits of integrating compound-specific and protein-contextual information.
Unlike previous studies, which treat AC and DTI predictions as separate
problems, this work establishes a unified framework to address both data
scarcity and prediction challenges in drug discovery."

proposed to solve this problem. In particular, machine learning approaches have
attracted increasing attentions recently. However, in addition to the known

propose a method based on low-rank matrix projection to solve the DTI

information of drugs or targets, the proposed method utilizes only the known
interactions. On the other hand, the proposed method can also utilize the extra
characteristic information when it is available and the performances will be
remarkably improved. Moreover, the proposed method can predict the interactions
associated with new drugs or targets of which we know nothing about their
associated interactions, but only some characteristic information. We compare
the proposed method with ten baseline methods, e.g., six similarity-based

vital significance for the drug development and the clinical practice.
Computational methods that rely on molecular dynamics simulations, Rosetta

specific scheme that starts with easy-to-learn samples and gradually
incorporates harder and diverse samples into the training, and then iterates
between sample weight recalculations and model updates. In addition, we
calculate additional physics-based structural features to provide the machine
learning model with the valuable domain knowledge on proteins for this

Mn2+-treatment does not induce major secondary structural changes of
alphaIIbbeta3. Similarly, we found that treatment with clinically relevant

diversity. In response, we propose a new method for fine-tuning molecular
generative LLMs to autoregressively generate a set of structurally diverse
molecules, where each molecule is generated by conditioning on the previously
generated molecules. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) supervised
fine-tuning to adapt LLMs to autoregressively generate molecules in a sequence
and (2) reinforcement learning to maximize structural diversity within the
generated molecules. Our experiments show that the proposed approach enables
LLMs to generate diverse molecules better than existing approaches for diverse
sequence generation."

off-target selectivity. CogMol combines adaptive pre-training of a molecular
SMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and an efficient multi-attribute
controlled sampling scheme that uses guidance from attribute predictors trained
on latent features. To generate novel and optimal drug-like molecules for
unseen viral targets, CogMol leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity
predictor that is trained using SMILES VAE embeddings and protein sequence
embeddings learned unsupervised from a large corpus. CogMol framework is
applied to three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins: main protease, receptor-binding
domain of the spike protein, and non-structural protein 9 replicase. The
generated candidates are novel at both molecular and chemical scaffold levels
when compared to the training data. CogMol also includes insilico screening for
assessing toxicity of parent molecules and their metabolites with a multi-task
toxicity classifier, synthetic feasibility with a chemical retrosynthesis
predictor, and target structure binding with docking simulations. Docking
reveals favorable binding of generated molecules to the target protein
structure, where 87-95 % of high affinity molecules showed docking free energy
< -6 kcal/mol. When compared to approved drugs, the majority of designed
compounds show low parent molecule and metabolite toxicity and high synthetic

synthesizable, low-toxic, drug-like molecules with high target specificity and

However, most existing methods focus exclusively on bottom-up de novo design of

Our in silico experiments demonstrate that DiffSBDD captures the statistics of
the ground truth data effectively. Furthermore, we show how additional

heterogeneous graph structure in the DTI network to address the challenge. For
better learning and interpreting the DTI topological structure and the

interactions from the graph structure.
  Results: We present an end-to-end framework, DTI-GAT (Drug-Target Interaction

incorporates a deep neural network architecture that operates on
graph-structured data with the attention mechanism, which leverages both the

facilitates the interpretation of the DTI topological structure by assigning
different attention weights to each node with the self-attention mechanism.
Experimental evaluations show that DTI-GAT outperforms various state-of-the-art

problems in drug design and discovery. Both ligand and target molecules are
represented as graphs with node and edge features encoding information about
atomic elements and bonds respectively. Although existing deep learning models
perform remarkably well at predicting physicochemical properties and binding
affinities, the generation of new molecules with optimized properties remains
challenging. Inherently, most GNNs perform poorly in whole-graph representation
due to the limitations of the message-passing paradigm. Furthermore,
step-by-step graph generation frameworks that use reinforcement learning or
other sequential processing can be slow and result in a high proportion of
invalid molecules with substantial post-processing needed in order to satisfy
the principles of stoichiometry. To address these issues, we propose a
representation-first approach to molecular graph generation. We guide the
latent representation of an autoencoder by capturing graph structure
information with the geometric scattering transform and apply penalties that
structure the representation also by molecular properties. We show that this
highly structured latent space can be directly used for molecular graph
generation by the use of a GAN. We demonstrate that our architecture learns
meaningful representations of drug datasets and provides a platform for
goal-directed drug synthesis."

Recent advances in this area have witnessed the adoption of deep generative

evaluation of these models centered on docking scores, which quantitatively
depict the predicted binding affinity between a molecule and its target pocket.
Though state-of-the-art models purport that a majority of their generated
ligands exceed the docking score of ground truth ligands in test sets, it begs
the question: Do these scores align with real-world biological needs? In this
paper, we introduce the delta score, a novel evaluation metric grounded in
tangible pharmaceutical requisites. Our experiments reveal that molecules
produced by current deep generative models significantly lag behind ground

health and an economic issue. Medication reviews are structured interviews of
the patient by the community pharmacist, aiming at optimizing the drug
treatment and deprescribing useless, redundant or dangerous drugs. However,
they remain difficult to perform and time-consuming. Several clinical decision
support systems were developed for helping clinicians to manage polypharmacy.
However, most were limited to the implementation of clinical practice
guidelines. In this work, our objective is to design an innovative clinical
decision support system for medication reviews and polypharmacy management,
named ABiMed.
  Methods: ABiMed associates several approaches: guidelines implementation, but
the automatic extraction of patient data from the GP's electronic health record
and its transfer to the pharmacist, and the visual presentation of
contextualized drug knowledge using visual analytics. We performed an ergonomic
assessment and qualitative evaluations involving pharmacists and GPs during
focus groups and workshops.
  Results: We describe the proposed architecture, which allows a collaborative
multi-user usage. We present the various screens of ABiMed for entering or
verifying patient data, for accessing drug knowledge (posology, adverse
effects, interactions), for viewing STOPP/START rules and for suggesting
modification to the treatment. Qualitative evaluations showed that health
professionals were highly interested by our approach, associating the automatic
guidelines execution with the visual presentation of drug knowledge.
  Conclusions: The association of guidelines implementation with visual
presentation of knowledge is a promising approach for managing polypharmacy.
Future works will focus on the improvement and the evaluation of ABiMed."

contrastive learning is utilized to harmonize the representations of diverse
data types. Our experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that
MIN surpasses other strong DTI prediction methods. Furthermore, the case study

discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery."

computational links we developed a data-driven chemical systems biology
approach to comprehensively study the relationship of 76 structural
3D-descriptors (VolSurf, chemical space) of 1159 drugs with the gene expression
responses (biological space) they elicited in three cancer cell lines. The
analysis covering 11350 genes was based on data from the Connectivity Map. We
decomposed these biological response profiles into components, each linked to a

analysis of the chemical and biological spaces was more informative about
protein-target based drug similarity than either dataset separately. We
identified ten major components that link distinct VolSurf features across
multiple compounds to specific biological activity types. For example,
component 2 (hydrophobic properties) strongly links to DNA damage response,
while component 3 (hydrogen bonding) connects to metabolic stress. Individual

appropriate tools to understand the extreme complexity of the aging process.
The generality of the network concept helps to define and study the aging of
technological, social networks and ecosystems, which may give novel concepts to
cure age-related diseases. The current review focuses on the role of
protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes) in aging. Hubs and
inter-modular elements of both interactomes and signaling networks are key
regulators of the aging process. Aging induces an increase in the permeability
of several cellular compartments, such as the cell nucleus, introducing gross
changes in the representation of network structures. The large overlap between
aging genes and genes of age-related major diseases makes drugs which aid
healthy aging promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of
age-related diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes and
neurodegenerative disorders. We also discuss a number of possible research
options to further explore the potential of the network concept in this
important field, and show that multi-target drugs (representing
""magic-buckshots"" instead of the traditional ""magic bullets"") may become an
especially useful class of age-related future drugs."

biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One
motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be
captured from images, from which similarities between different drug compounds
applied at different doses can be quantified. The general approach is to find a
function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality
whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important
known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from
nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more
correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than
for those from different weeks, despite having identical drug compounds applied
in both cases. In this case, the particular batch in which a set of experiments
were conducted constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image
embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug
effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in
order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant
biological information. To achieve this, we minimize a loss function based on
distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of
embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset we
present results with, the only replicated treatment happens to be the negative
control treatment, for which we do not expect any treatment-induced cell
morphology changes. We find that for our transformed embeddings (i) the
underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also
carry improved biological signal; and (ii) less domain-specific information is
present."

in generating promising drug molecules. The fine-tuning task is often
formulated as a reinforcement learning problem, where previous methods
efficiently learn to optimize a reward function to generate potential drug
molecules. Nevertheless, in the absence of an adaptive update mechanism for the
reward function, the optimization process can become stuck in local optima. The
efficacy of the optimal molecule in a local optimization may not translate to
usefulness in the subsequent drug optimization process or as a potential
standalone clinical candidate. Therefore, it is important to generate a diverse
set of promising molecules. Prior work has modified the reward function by
penalizing structurally similar molecules, primarily focusing on finding
molecules with higher rewards. To date, no study has comprehensively examined
how different adaptive update mechanisms for the reward function influence the
diversity of generated molecules. In this work, we investigate a wide range of
intrinsic motivation methods and strategies to penalize the extrinsic reward,

conducted a user study with drug discovery researchers to identify the

1) an LLM should provide multiple Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) based on
an initial protein and protein candidates that have a therapeutic impact; 2)
the model must provide the PPI and relevant explanations for better

personalized drug targets (PDTs) from high-dimensional personalized genomic
profile of individual patients. Recent structural network control principles
have introduced a new approach to discover PDTs by selecting an optimal set of
driver genes in personalized gene interaction network (PGIN). However, most of
current methods only focus on controlling the system through a minimum
driver-node set and ignore the existence of multiple candidate driver-node sets
for therapeutic drug target identification in PGIN. Therefore, this paper
proposed multi-objective optimization-based structural network control
principles (MONCP) by considering minimum driver nodes and maximum prior-known
drug-target information. To solve MONCP, a discrete multi-objective
optimization problem is formulated with many constrained variables, and a novel
evolutionary optimization model called LSCV-MCEA was developed by adapting a
multi-tasking framework and a rankings-based fitness function method. With
genomics data of patients with breast or lung cancer from The Cancer Genome
Atlas database, the effectiveness of LSCV-MCEA was validated. The experimental
results indicated that compared with other advanced methods, LSCV-MCEA can more
effectively identify PDTs with the highest Area Under the Curve score for
predicting clinically annotated combinatorial drugs. Meanwhile, LSCV-MCEA can
more effectively solve MONCP than other evolutionary optimization methods in
terms of algorithm convergence and diversity. Particularly, LSCV-MCEA can

In this work, we introduce TarLig, a novel approach that aims to bridge the gap

binding site as input to a model which predicts the ligand preferences of the
binding site. The resulting predictions could then offer promising seeds and
constraints in the chemical space search, based on the binding site structure.
TarLig outperforms standard models by introducing a data-alignment and

new coronavirus that is rapidly spreading throughout the human population. Over
the past 6 months, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, has already infected over
11.6 million (25% located in United States) and killed more than 540K people
around the world. As we face one of the most challenging times in our recent
history, there is an urgent need to identify drug candidates that can attack
SARS-CoV-2 on multiple fronts. We have therefore initiated a computational
dynamics drug pipeline using molecular modeling, structure simulation, docking
and machine learning models to predict the inhibitory activity of several
million compounds against two essential SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and their
host protein interactors; S/Ace2, Tmprss2, Cathepsins L and K, and Mpro to
prevent binding, membrane fusion and replication of the virus, respectively.
All together we generated an ensemble of structural conformations that increase
high quality docking outcomes to screen over >6 million compounds including all
FDA-approved drugs, drugs under clinical trial (>3000) and an additional >30
million selected chemotypes from fragment libraries. Our results yielded an
initial set of 350 high value compounds from both new and FDA-approved
compounds that can now be tested experimentally in appropriate biological model
systems. We anticipate that our results will initiate screening campaigns and
accelerate the discovery of COVID-19 treatments."

drug discovery. However, structure-activity data are high dimensional with low
signal-to-noise ratios and proper validation of predictive methods is
difficult. It is poorly understood which, if any, of the currently available
machine learning algorithms will best predict new candidate drugs. 25 publicly
available molecular datasets were extracted from ChEMBL. Neural nets, random
forests, support vector machines (regression) and ridge regression were then
fitted to the structure-activity data. A new validation method, based on
quantile splits on the activity distribution function, is proposed for the
construction of training and testing sets. Model validation based on random
partitioning of available data favours models which overfit and `memorize' the
training set, namely random forests and deep neural nets. Partitioning based on
quantiles of the activity distribution correctly penalizes models which can
extrapolate onto structurally different molecules outside of the training data.
This approach favours more constrained models, namely ridge regression and
support vector regression. In addition, our new rank-based loss functions give
considerably different results from mean squared error highlighting the
necessity to define model optimality with respect to the decision task at hand.
Model performance should be evaluated from a decision theoretic perspective
with subjective loss functions. Data-splitting based on the separation of high

extrapolating model. Simpler, traditional statistical methods such as ridge
regression outperform state-of-the-art machine learning methods in this

an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a

significant challenges in developing effective cancer therapies. In particular,
many tumors harbor a variety of subpopulations with distinct therapeutic
response characteristics. Characterizing this heterogeneity by determining the
subpopulation structure within a tumor enables more precise and successful
treatment strategies. In our prior work, we developed PhenoPop, a computational
framework for unravelling the drug-response subpopulation structure within a
tumor from bulk high-throughput drug screening data. However, the deterministic
nature of the underlying models driving PhenoPop restricts the model fit and
the information it can extract from the data. As an advancement, we propose a
stochastic model based on the linear birth-death process to address this
limitation. Our model can formulate a dynamic variance along the horizon of the
experiment so that the model uses more information from the data to provide a
more robust estimation. In addition, the newly proposed model can be readily
adapted to situations where the experimental data exhibits a positive time
correlation. We test our model on simulated data (in silico) and experimental

has been a hot research topic, where an important branch is molecule generation
by generative models, from GAN-based models and VAE-based models to the latest
diffusion-based models. However, most existing models pursue only the basic
properties like validity and uniqueness of the generated molecules, a few go
further to explicitly optimize one single important molecular property (e.g.
QED or PlogP), which makes most generated molecules little usefulness in
practice. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generating molecules
with desirable properties, which expands the diffusion model framework with
multiple innovative designs. The novelty is two-fold. On the one hand,
considering that the structures of molecules are complex and diverse, and
molecular properties are usually determined by some substructures (e.g.
pharmacophores), we propose to perform diffusion on two structural levels:
molecules and molecular fragments respectively, with which a mixed Gaussian
distribution is obtained for the reverse diffusion process. To get desirable
molecular fragments, we develop a novel electronic effect based fragmentation
method. On the other hand, we introduce two ways to explicitly optimize
multiple molecular properties under the diffusion model framework. First, as
potential drug molecules must be chemically valid, we optimize molecular
validity by an energy-guidance function. Second, since potential drug molecules
should be desirable in various properties, we employ a multi-objective
mechanism to optimize multiple molecular properties simultaneously. Extensive
experiments with two benchmark datasets QM9 and ZINC250k show that the

the molecules. The binding energies of the modified C 1s sites in the molecules
shift as much as 1.8 eV, whereas the electronic changes in their O 1s spectra
happen in the higher energy region (ca. 536 eV). The valence spectra provide
enhanced insights on the reactivity and chemical properties of the aromatic
molecules. The impacts of OH moieties on the valence spectra are predominantly
focussed in the energy band<16 eV, where the frontier molecular orbitals
display much reorganization and energy shifts from the amino acids to L-dopa.
Of the three molecules, L-dopa also has the least HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which
can readily explain its proactivity as a drug compound. Furthermore, the
nuclear independent chemical shift calculations suggest that L-dopa also has
more aromaticity features than those of the amino acids. The OH groups,
therefore, play a more prominent role in shaping the physico-chemical
properties of L-dopa, which significantly improve its drug potency."

drug loading capacity in these carriers. It is extremely challenging to
determine the nanostructure within these carriers through the implementation of

grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was utilized to model different
lipid-based nanoparticles of the diameter about 12 nm including solid lipid
nanoparticles (SLN), nanoemulsion (NE), and nanostructured lipid carriers
(NLC), and the organization of the lipids within the carriers was explored. The
aforementioned nanoparticles consisted of stearic acid, oleic acid as lipids,
and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant in water medium. Furthermore,
the impact of solid to liquid mass ratio on the lipid distribution within the
lipid matrix was investigated regarding the NLC simulations. We observed the
vesicle-like structure for all the investigated systems in which the
hydrophilic moieties of the lipids and surfactant organized a semi-bilayer fold
into the droplet and the hydrophobic tails accumulated among them. It is worth
mentioning although SDS as a harsh surfactant, which is a special case, was
expected to be present in the surface of the droplet, it penetrated into the
lipids. Our results showed remarkable entrapped water beads inside the droplet
in the form of one or more cavities along the internal layer of the head groups

building structure of the nanoemulsion and SLN, in the central parts of the

the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and
outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research
attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep
learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is
capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature
extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for
CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular
input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the
chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover
hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous
interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging
techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep
classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI
showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition,
the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically
extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the
significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to
improve prediction performance, in drug analyses."

(NLP) to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for computational phenotyping.
NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including
diagnosis categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening,
pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and adverse drug event (ADE)
detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.
Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource
construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods,
well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good
performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires
significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine
learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both
classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and
unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored
for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes.
Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and
have shown promise in improving model performance. Often better performance is
achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many
advances, challenges and opportunities remain for NLP-based computational
phenotyping, including better model interpretability and generalizability, and
proper characterization of feature relations in clinical narratives"

  initial submission version","In this paper, we present the design and the analysis of an electrochemical
circuit for measuring the concentrations of therapeutic drugs using
structure-switching aptamers. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids, whose
sequence is selected to exhibit high affinity and specificity toward a
molecular target, and change its conformation upon binding. This property, when
coupled with a redox reporter and electrochemical detection, enables
reagent-free biosensing with a sub-minute temporal resolution for in vivo
therapeutic drug monitoring. Specifically, we design a chronoamperometry-based
electrochemical circuit that measures the direct changes in the electron
transfer (ET) kinetics of a methylene blue reporter conjugated at the
distal-end of the aptamer. To overcome the high-frequency noise amplification
issue when interfacing with a large-size (> 0.25 mm2) implantable electrode, we
present a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit technique in which the desired
electrode potentials are held onto noiseless capacitors during the recording of
the redox currents. This allows disconnecting the feedback amplifiers to avoid
its noise injection while reducing the total power consumption. A prototype
circuit implemented in 65-nm CMOS demonstrates a cell-capacitance-insensitive
input-referred noise (IRN) current of 15.2 pArms at a 2.5-kHz filtering
bandwidth. Tested in human whole blood samples, changes in the ET kinetics from
the redox-labeled aminoglycoside aptamers at different kanamycin concentrations
are measured from the recorded current waveforms. By employing principal
component analysis (PCA) to compensate for the sampling errors, a detection
limit (SNR = 1) of 3.1 uM under 1-sec acquisition is achieved at 0.22-mW power

Firstly, Carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classification can help people to
understand the properties of enzymes. However, one CAZyme may belong to several
classes. This leads to Multi-label CAZyme classification. Secondly, to capture
information from the secondary structure of protein, protein classification is
modeled as graph classification problem. Thirdly, compound-protein interactions
prediction employs graph learning for compound with sequential embedding for
protein. This can be seen as classification task for compound-protein pairs.
This paper proposes three models for protein classification. Firstly, this
paper proposes a Multi-label CAZyme classification model using CNN-LSTM with
Attention mechanism. Secondly, this paper proposes a variational graph
autoencoder based subspace learning model for protein graph classification.
Thirdly, this paper proposes graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and

processes. Diseases occur when normal functionality of these processes is
disrupted. Thus, understanding these biochemical processes and their
interrelationships is a primary task in biomedical research and a prerequisite
for diagnosing diseases, and drug development. Scientists studying these
processes have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, and
signal transduction, etc.
  Newer techniques and speed improvements have resulted in deeper knowledge
about these pathways, resulting in refined models that tend to be large and
complex, making it difficult for a person to remember all aspects of it. Thus,
computer models are needed to analyze them. We want to build such a system that
allows modeling of biological systems and pathways in such a way that we can
answer questions about them.
  Many existing models focus on structural and/or factoid questions, using
surface-level knowledge that does not require understanding the underlying
model. We believe these are not the kind of questions that a biologist may ask
someone to test their understanding of the biological processes. We want our
system to answer the kind of questions a biologist may ask. Such questions
appear in early college level text books.
  Thus the main goal of our thesis is to develop a system that allows us to
encode knowledge about biological pathways and answer such questions about them
demonstrating understanding of the pathway. To that end, we develop a language
that will allow posing such questions and illustrate the utility of our
framework with various applications in the biological domain. We use some
existing tools with modifications to accomplish our goal.
  Finally, we apply our system to real world applications by extracting pathway

predict four human pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: A pharmacokinetic
dataset included 1104 U.S. FDA approved small molecule drugs. The dataset
included four human pharmacokinetic parameter subsets (oral bioavailability,
plasma protein binding rate, apparent volume of distribution at steady-state
and elimination half-life). The pre-trained model was trained on over 30

The pharmacokinetic dataset was split into three parts (60:20:20) for training,
validation and test by the improved Maximum Dissimilarity algorithm with the
representative initial set selection algorithm and the weighted distance

ELMo is used to generate contextualized embedding vectors of the protein

Still, two imminent challenges exist for this task. First, the models often

same drug class from nearby locations have the greatest influence on future OOD
trends. Furthermore, the expected proportion of OODs triggered by historical
events varies greatly across counties, ranging between 30%-70%. Finally, in a
practical online forecasting setting, STEMMED-based cooperative framework
reduces prediction error by 60% on average, compared to well-established
forecasting models. Leveraging the growing abundance of public health
surveillance data, STEMMED can provide accurate forecasts of local OOD trends

challenging task in drug discovery. Previous works usually generate atoms in an
auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are
generated one by one. However, in real-world molecular systems, the
interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the
energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration,
the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than
sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive
modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus
resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a
generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins
as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a
non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model
learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D
coordinates of an entire molecule, with an equivariant network. Experimentally,
the proposed method shows competitive performance compared with prevailing
works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as
well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules."

predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in
absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been
applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD
is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a
signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation,
however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer
conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study,
we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo
simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at
modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to
the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced
quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model
to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five

toxicity (ADMET) of small molecules from their molecular structure is a central
problem in medicinal chemistry with great practical importance in drug
discovery. Creating predictive models conventionally requires substantial
trial-and-error for the selection of molecular representations, machine
learning (ML) algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning. A generally applicable
method that performs well on all datasets without tuning would be of great
value but is currently lacking. Here, we describe Pareto-Optimal Embedded
Modeling (POEM), a similarity-based method for predicting molecular properties.
POEM is a non-parametric, supervised ML algorithm developed to generate
reliable predictive models without need for optimization. POEMs predictive
strength is obtained by combining multiple different representations of
molecular structures in a context-specific manner, while maintaining low
dimensionality. We benchmark POEM relative to industry-standard ML algorithms
and published results across 17 classifications tasks. POEM performs well in
all cases and reduces the risk of overfitting."

members of a hidden or hard-to-reach population such as sex workers, homeless
people, or drug users via their social network. Most methodological work on RDS
has focused on inference of population means under the assumption that
subjects' network degree determines their probability of being sampled.
Criticism of existing estimators is usually focused on missing data: the
underlying network is only partially observed, so it is difficult to determine
correct sampling probabilities. In this paper, we show that data collected in
ordinary RDS studies contain information about the structure of the
respondents' social network. We construct a continuous-time model of RDS
recruitment that incorporates the time series of recruitment events, the
pattern of coupon use, and the network degrees of sampled subjects. Together,
the observed data and the recruitment model place a well-defined probability
distribution on the recruitment-induced subgraph of respondents. We show that
this distribution can be interpreted as an exponential random graph model and
develop a computationally efficient method for estimating the hidden graph. We
validate the method using simulated data and apply the technique to an RDS
study of injection drug users in St. Petersburg, Russia."

them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties

field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with
a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear
solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular
dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that
LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and
are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these
properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also
offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs
with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being
surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the
superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles."

structure at a submicroscopic level for some unstable, noncrystalline and
insoluble proteins. X-ray crystallography finds the X-ray final structure of a

fibrils (which are unstable, noncrystalline and insoluble), from the potential
energy minimization point of view. Because the NMR or X-ray structure of the

drug--target interaction. In the case in which the target is a viral protein
displaying a high mutation rate, a second problem arises, namely the eventual
development of resistance. We wish to suggest a scheme for the design of
non--conventional drugs which do not face any of these problems and apply it to
the case of HIV--1 protease. It is based on the knowledge that the folding of
single--domain proteins, like e.g. each of the monomers forming the HIV--1--PR
homodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES), stabilized by
local contacts among hydrophobic, strongly interacting and highly conserved
amino acids which play a central role in the folding process. Because LES have
evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly interact with
each other so as to make the protein fold fast as well as to avoid aggregation
with other proteins, highly specific (and thus little toxic) as well as
effective folding--inhibitor drugs suggest themselves: short peptides (or
eventually their mimetic molecules), displaying the same amino acid sequence of
that of LES (p--LES). Aside from being specific and efficient, these inhibitors
are expected not to induce resistance: in fact, mutations which successfully
avoid their action imply the destabilization of one or more LES and thus should
lead to protein denaturation. Making use of Monte Carlo simulations within the
framework of a simple although not oversimplified model, which is able to
reproduce the main thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of monoglobular
proteins, we first identify the LES of the HIV--1--PR and then show that the
corresponding p--LES peptides act as effective inhibitors of the folding of the

have attracted a considerable attention in cancer research. Yet some important
challenges are still to be faced, including an optimal coupling between these
two types of properties that would be effective within complex biological
tissues. To address these points, we have prepared novel nanoplatforms
associating controlled drug delivery of doxorubicin and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) contrast-enhancement that exhibit high specificity towards cancer
cells compared to normal cells and evaluated them both in 2D cultures and
within 3D tissue-like biomimetic matrices. Methods: Nanoplatforms were prepared
from hollow silica nanoparticles coated with MnO2 nanosheets and conjugated
with the AS1411 aptamer as a targeting agent. They were fully characterized
from a chemical and structural point of view as well as for drug release and
MRI signal enhancement. Standard two-dimensional monolayer cultures were
performed using HeLa and Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) cells to
testify targeting and cytotoxicity. Cellularized type I collagen-based
hydrogels were also used to study nanoparticles behavior in 3D biomimetic
environments. Results: The as-established nanoplatforms can enter HeLa cells,
leading to the dissociation of the MnO2 nanosheets into Mn 2+ that enhanced T1
magnetic resonance signals and concomitantly release doxorubicin, both effects
being markedly more significant than in the presence of NHDFs. Moreover,
particles functionality and specificity were preserved when the cells were
immobilized within type I collagen-based fibrillar hydrogels. Conclusion: The
use of MnO2 nanosheets as glutathione-sensitive coatings of drug loaded
nanoparticles together with surface conjugation with a targeting aptamer offers
an effective strategy to obtain efficient and specific nanotheranostic systems

frequently associated with inhibition of bile salt transporters, such as the
bile salt export pump (BSEP). Reliable in silico models to predict BSEP
inhibition directly from chemical structures would significantly reduce costs
during drug discovery and could help avoid injury to patients. Unfortunately,
models published to date have been insufficiently accurate to encourage wide
adoption. We report our development of classification and regression models for
BSEP inhibition with substantially improved performance over previously
published models. Our model development leveraged the ATOM Modeling PipeLine
(AMPL) developed by the ATOM Consortium, which enabled us to train and evaluate
thousands of candidate models. In the course of model development, we assessed
a variety of schemes for chemical featurization, dataset partitioning and class
labeling, and identified those producing models that generalized best to novel
chemical entities. Our best performing classification model was a neural
network with ROC AUC = 0.88 on our internal test dataset and 0.89 on an
independent external compound set. Our best regression model, the first ever
reported for predicting BSEP IC50s, yielded a test set $R^2 = 0.56$ and mean
absolute error 0.37, corresponding to a mean 2.3-fold error in predicted IC50s,
comparable to experimental variation. These models will thus be useful as
inputs to mechanistic predictions of DILI and as part of computational
pipelines for drug discovery."

disciplines such as Social sciences and Ecology for decades. So far, NA has not
been used extensively in studies of medication use. Only a handful of papers
have used NA in Drug Prescription Networks (DPN). We provide an introduction to
NA terminology alongside a guide to creating and extracting results from the
medication networks. Objective: To introduce the readers to NA as a tool to
study medication use by demonstrating how to apply different NA measures on 3
generated medication networks. Methods: We used the Norwegian Prescription
Database (NorPD) to create a network that describes the co-medication in
elderly persons in Norway on January 1, 2013. We used the Norwegian Electronic
Prescription Support System (FEST) to create another network of severe
drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Lastly, we created a network combining the two
networks to show the actual use of drugs with severe DDIs. We used these
networks to elucidate how to apply and interpret different network measures in
medication networks. Results: Interactive network graphs are made available
online, Stata and R syntaxes are provided. Various useful network measures for
medication networks were applied such as network topological features,
modularity analysis and centrality measures. Edge lists data used to generate
the networks are openly available for readers in an open data repository to
explore and use. Conclusion: We believe that NA can be a useful tool in
medication use studies. We have provided information and hopefully inspiration
for other researchers to use NA in their own projects. While network analyses
are useful for exploring and discovering structures in medication use studies,
it also has limitations. It can be challenging to interpret and it is not
suitable for hypothesis testing."

that they require exceptional computing capabilities to consider for even

  Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a recently proposed learning paradigm
that is able to leverage low-precision binary vector arithmetic to build
efficient representations of the data that can be obtained without the need for
gradient-based optimization approaches that are required in many conventional
machine learning and deep learning approaches. This algorithmic simplicity
allows for acceleration in hardware that has been previously demonstrated for a
range of application areas. We consider existing HDC approaches for molecular
property classification and introduce two novel encoding algorithms that
leverage the extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) algorithm.
  We show that HDC-based inference methods are as much as 90 times more
efficient than more complex representative machine learning methods and achieve
an acceleration of nearly 9 orders of magnitude as compared to inference with
molecular docking. We demonstrate multiple approaches for the encoding of
molecular data for HDC and examine their relative performance on a range of
challenging molecular property prediction and drug-protein binding
classification tasks. Our work thus motivates further investigation into
molecular representation learning to develop ultra-efficient pre-screening

precision. GCNs excel at capturing intricate molecular topologies by modeling
the relationships between atoms and bonds. Transformers, with their
self-attention mechanisms, effectively identify long-range dependencies within
molecules, capturing global interactions. LSTMs process sequential data,
preserving long-term dependencies and integrating temporal information within
molecular sequences. This multifaceted approach leverages the strengths of each

The integration of these deep learning techniques allows the YZS-Model to learn
valuable features from complex data without predefined parameters, handle large

adding elements such as multiple-conformer inputs and conformer attention. We
then benchmark the performance trade-offs of these models on 2D, 3D and 4D

which no data was available during training and where the decoder can be
unreliable, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid objects. We
propose to leverage the epistemic uncertainty of the decoder to guide the
optimization process. This is not trivial though, as a naive estimation of
uncertainty in the high-dimensional and structured settings we consider would
result in high estimator variance. To solve this problem, we introduce an
importance sampling-based estimator that provides more robust estimates of

require modifications of the model architecture nor the training process. It
produces samples with a better trade-off between black-box objective and

clinical settings, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the
internal structure of lipid nanoparticles. Through synchrotron small-angle
X-ray scattering experiments, we determined the spatial distribution and
internal structure of the nanoparticles' lipid, surfactant, and the water in
them. The nanoparticles themselves have a barrel-like shape that consists of
coplanar lipid platelets (specifically cetyl palmitate) that are partially
covered by polysorbate 80 surfactant and retain a small amount of hydration
water. Although the platelet structure was expected, the presence of surfactant
molecules forming sticky patches between adjacent platelets challenges the
classical core-shell model used to describe solid lipid nanoparticles.
Additionally, the surfactant partially covers the water-nanoparticle interface,
allowing certain lipid regions to come into direct contact with surrounding
water. These structural features play a significant role in drug loading and
release, biological fluid interaction, and nanoparticle stability, making these
findings valuable for the rational design of lipid-based nanoparticles."

sufficient to express the biological and pharmacological effects of the ligand.
It is usually a substructure of the entire structure of the ligand. Small
organic molecules called ligands or metabolites in the cell form complexes with
biomolecules (usually proteins) to serve different purposes. The sites at which
the ligands bind are known as ligand binding sites, which are essentially
""pockets"" which have complementary shapes and patterns of charge distribution
with the ligands. Sometimes a pocket is induced by the ligand itself. If we
study different bound conformations of ligands it is found that they share a
specific three- dimensional pattern that is more or less common and is
responsible for its binding and which is complementary in three-dimensional
geometry and charge distribution pattern with its cognate binding site in the
protein. This work studies the three dimensional structure of the consensus
ligand binding site for the ligand FMN. A training set for the ligand binding
sites was made and a 3D consensus binding site motif was determined for FMN.
The FMN system was studied and its binding sites in its respective regulator
proteins. The ability to identify ligand binding site by scanning the 3D
binding site consensus motif in protein 3D structures is an important step in
drug target discovery. Once a pharmacophore template is found it can also be
used to design other potential molecules that can bind to it and thus serve as
novel drugs."

adopted in computer-aided drug discoveries for drug design and screening.
Although it has been several decades since its first edition, the current
template-based modeling approach suffers from two critical problems: 1) there
are many missing regions in the template-query sequence alignment, and 2) the
accuracy of the distance pairs from different regions of the template varies,
and this information is not well introduced into the modeling. To solve these
two problems, we propose a structural optimization process based on template
modeling, introducing two neural network models to predict the distance
information of the missing regions and the accuracy of the distance pairs of
different regions in the template modeling structure. The predicted distances
and residue pairwise-specific deviations are incorporated into the potential
energy function for structural optimization, which significantly improves the

kernel matrix using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm while using kernel principal

matrix that satisfies the constraints of a probability distribution. This is
achieved by iteratively adjusting the kernel matrix until the marginal

We provided a comprehensive empirical analysis of the proposed kernel method to

a rapidly evolving modality in drug discovery, targeting proteins traditionally

TPD. Both types of molecules form a ternary complex linking an E3 ligase with a
target protein, a crucial step for drug discovery. While significant advances
have been made in binary structure prediction for proteins and small molecules,
ternary structure prediction remains challenging due to obscure interaction
mechanisms and insufficient training data. Traditional methods relying on
manually assigned rules perform poorly and are computationally demanding due to
extensive random sampling. In this work, we introduce DeepTernary, a novel deep
learning-based approach that directly predicts ternary structures in an
end-to-end manner using an encoder-decoder architecture. DeepTernary leverages
an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both intra-graph and
ternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary
interactions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB. The
proposed query-based Pocket Points Decoder extracts the 3D structure of the
final binding ternary complex from learned ternary embeddings, demonstrating
state-of-the-art accuracy and speed in existing PROTAC benchmarks without prior
knowledge from known PROTACs. It also achieves notable accuracy on the more
challenging MGD benchmark under the blind docking protocol. Remarkably, our
experiments reveal that the buried surface area calculated from predicted

performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks.
Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation,
including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent

including aggregation, structured sparse methods are still emerging. We
demonstrate a general framework for structured sparse aggregation that allows
for a wide variety of structures, including overlapping grouped structures and

We show that such estimators satisfy structured sparse oracle inequalities ---
their finite sample risk adapts to the structured sparsity of the target. These

that this phenomenon is essentially controlled by conserved (native) contacts
among (few) strongly interacting (""hot""), as a rule hydrophobic, amino acids,
which also stabilize local elementary structures (LES, hidden, incipient
secondary structures like $\alpha$--helices and $\beta$--sheets) formed early
in the folding process and leading to the postcritical folding nucleus (i.e.,
the minimum set of native contacts which bring the system pass beyond the
highest free--energy barrier found in the whole folding process) it is possible
to work out a succesful strategy for reading the native structure of designed
proteins from the knowledge of only their amino acid sequence and of the
contact energies among the amino acids. Because LES have undergone millions of
years of evolution to selectively dock to their complementary structures, small
peptides made out of the same amino acids as the LES are expected to
selectively attach to the newly expressed (unfolded) protein and inhibit its
folding, or to the native (fluctuating) native conformation and denaturate it.
These peptides, or their mimetic molecules, can thus be used as effective

binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models
require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded
as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model
to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general
3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical
interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application
to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural
network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of
a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with
the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding
pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the
protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the
interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by
predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes
found in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics
and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve
experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform
or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all
previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are
end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven,
physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for
future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction."

general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable
""ground rules"", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor
intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an
allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation --
governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a
structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of
localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation.
Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes
uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and
non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently
transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in
proteins and ""pseudoproteins"" -- networks designed to display an allosteric
response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric
transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate
how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully

structure-based drug design by learning to generate ligands given target
binding sites. However, only modeling the target-ligand distribution can hardly
fulfill one of the main goals in drug discovery -- designing novel ligands with
desired properties, e.g., high binding affinity, easily synthesizable, etc.
This challenge becomes particularly pronounced when the target-ligand pairs
used for training do not align with these desired properties. Moreover, most
existing methods aim at solving \textit{de novo} design task, while many
generative scenarios requiring flexible controllability, such as R-group
optimization and scaffold hopping, have received little attention. In this
work, we propose DecompOpt, a structure-based molecular optimization method
based on a controllable and decomposed diffusion model. DecompOpt presents a
new generation paradigm which combines optimization with conditional diffusion
models to achieve desired properties while adhering to the molecular grammar.
Additionally, DecompOpt offers a unified framework covering both \textit{de
novo} design and controllable generation. To achieve so, ligands are decomposed
into substructures which allows fine-grained control and local optimization.
Experiments show that DecompOpt can efficiently generate molecules with
improved properties than strong de novo baselines, and demonstrate great
potential in controllable generation tasks."

distillate the knowledge from spatial molecular structures datasets. After
fine-tuning within both single-task and multi-task frameworks, nach0-pc
demonstrates performance comparable with other diffusion models in terms of
generated samples quality across several established spatial molecular

diffusion models being limited to single tasks. Additionally, it is capable of
processing point cloud-related data, which language models are not capable of

objectives (a) Data Structuring developing a Registration Aided Automated

data, and (b) Survival Analysis creating imaging features and models from RAMAC
structured data to predict patient outcomes. The RAMAC algorithm uses a two
phase pipeline: three dimensional rigid registration aligns CT images, and a
distance metric-based Hungarian algorithm tracks lesion correspondence. Using
structured data, we developed interpretable models to assess progression-free
survival (PFS) in mBC patients by combining baseline radiomics, post-treatment
changes (Weeks 8, 16, 24), and demographic features. Radiomics effects were
studied across time points separately and through a non-correlated additive

discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential
bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures
using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable
methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to
biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers
both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel
therapeutics.\\ Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small
molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein
targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art
performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and
robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the
Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth
analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding
stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and
whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight
the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from
the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular
pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion:
Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and

beneficial in several domains. For example, in the drug discovery field, a
protein conformational pathway, i.e. a highly probable sequence of protein
structural changes, is useful to analyze interactions between the protein and

in drug discovery was presented, which efficiently computes protein pathways
using latent variables obtained from an isometric auto-encoding of the space of
3D density maps associated to protein conformations. However, our preliminary
experiments show that there is room to significantly reduce the computing time.
In this study, we use the Mapper algorithm, which is a Topological Data
Analysis method, and present a novel variant to extract plausible
conformational pathways from the isometric latent space with comparatively
short running time. The extracted pathways are visualized as paths on the
resulting Mapper graph. The methodological novelties are described as follows:
firstly, the filter function of the Mapper algorithm is optimized so as to
extract the pathways via minimization of an energy loss defined on the Mapper
graph itself, while filter functions taken in the classical Mapper algorithm
are fixed beforehand. The optimization is with respect to parameters of a deep
neural network in the filter. Secondly, the clustering method, which defines
the vertices and edges of the Mapper graph, of our algorithm, is designed by
incorporating domain prior knowledge to assist the extraction. In our numerical
experiments, based on an isometric latent space built on the common
50S-ribosomal dataset, the resulting Mapper graph successfully includes all the

heart's natural pacemaker (sinoatrial node). However, the complicated structure
of cardiac tissue, as well as the complex ionic currents in the cell, has made
it extremely difficult to pinpoint the detailed mechanisms of these
life-threatening reentrant arrhythmias. A simplified ionic model of the cardiac
action potential (AP), which can be fitted to a wide variety of experimentally

AP shape and restitution of AP duration and conduction velocity, is used to
explain many different mechanisms of spiral wave breakup which in principle can

observed before using other models; therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
demonstrate them using just one framework model and to explain the different

spiral tip trajectory types, and tissue structures such as rotational
anisotropy and periodic boundary conditions). Each mechanism is compared with

This leads to increased plasticity of signaling and cellular networks.
Increased plasticity is both substantiated by and inducing an increased noise

However, these approaches are limited since their representations ignore the
three-dimensional (3D) structure of molecules. In fact, geometry plays an
important role in many applications in inverse molecular design, especially in
drug discovery. Thus, it is important to build models that can generate
molecular structures in 3D space based on property-oriented geometric
constraints. To address this, one approach is to generate molecules as 3D point
clouds by sequentially placing atoms at locations in space -- this allows the
process to be guided by physical quantities such as energy or other properties.
However, this approach is inefficient as placing individual atoms makes the
exploration unnecessarily deep, limiting the complexity of molecules that can
be generated. Moreover, when optimizing a molecule, organic and medicinal
chemists use known fragments and functional groups, not single atoms. We

generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket like in early
attempts, in VD-Gen, we first randomly initialize many virtual particles in the
pocket; then iteratively move these virtual particles, making the distribution
of virtual particles approximate the distribution of molecular atoms. After
virtual particles are stabilized in 3D space, we extract a 3D molecule from
them. Finally, we further refine atoms in the extracted molecule by iterative
movement again, to get a high-quality 3D molecule, and predict a confidence
score for it. Extensive experiment results on pocket-based molecular generation
demonstrate that VD-Gen can generate novel 3D molecules to fill the target
pocket cavity with high binding affinities, significantly outperforming

time-dependent loss weighting, substantially increasing training convergence,
the quality of generated samples, and inference time. We also showcase that
including chemically motivated additional features like hybridization states in
the diffusion process enhances the validity of generated molecules. To further
strengthen the applicability of diffusion models to limited training data, we
investigate the transferability of EQGAT-diff trained on the large PubChem3D

Fine-tuning EQGAT-diff for just a few iterations shows an efficient

of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with
shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in
volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and
environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose
maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we
demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating
spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional
metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive
cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against
which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and
hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too
slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven
local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through
simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and
environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication.
We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR
eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance
of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our

for maintaining their stability and functionality. It is necessary for a
variety of membranes, including planar bilayers, liposomes, curved bilayers,
nanodiscs, and proteoliposomes. Cholesterol regulates membrane properties by
influencing the density of lipids, phase separation into liquid-ordered (Lo)
and liquid-disordered (Ld) areas, and stability of protein--membrane
interactions. For planar bilayers, cholesterol thickens the membrane, decreases
permeability, and brings lipids into well-ordered domains, adding rigidity and
fluidity. It modulates membrane curvature in curved bilayers and vesicles, and
stabilises low-curvature regions, which are important for structural integrity.
In liposomes, cholesterol facilitates drug encapsulation and release by
controlling bilayer flexibility and stability. In nanodiscs, cholesterol
enhances structural integrity and protein compatibility, which enables the
investigation of protein--lipid interactions under physiological conditions. In
proteoliposomes, cholesterol regulates the conformational stability of embedded

performed by the pharmacist and aimed at optimizing drug treatments. In
practice, medication review is a long and cognitively-demanding task that
requires specific knowledge. Clinical practice guidelines have been proposed,
but their application is tedious. Methods: We designed ABiMed, a clinical
decision support system for medication reviews, based on the implementation of
the STOPP/START v2 guidelines and on the visual presentation of aggregated drug
knowledge using tables, graphs and flower glyphs. We evaluated ABiMed with 39
community pharmacists during a randomized simulation trial, each pharmacist
performing a medication review for two fictitious patients without ABiMed, and
two others with ABiMed. We recorded the problems identified by the pharmacists,
the interventions proposed, the response time, the perceived usability and the
comments. Pharmacists' medication reviews were compared to an expert-designed
gold standard. Results: With ABiMed, pharmacists found 1.6 times more relevant
drug-related problems during the medication review (p=1.1e-12) and proposed
better interventions (p=9.8e-9), without needing more time (p=0.56). The System
Usability Scale score is 82.7, which is ranked ""excellent"". In their comments,
pharmacists appreciated the visual aspect of ABiMed and its ability to compare
the current treatment with the proposed one. A multifactor analysis showed no
difference in the support offered by ABiMed according to the pharmacist's age
or sex, in terms of percentage of problems identified or quality of the
proposed interventions. Conclusions: The use of an intelligent and visual
clinical decision support system can help pharmacists when they perform
medication reviews. Our main perspective is the validation of the system in
clinical conditions."

the assumption that the experimentally found discrete ion conduction events are
due to a particular class of proteins called ion channels while the lipid
membrane is considered being an inert electrical insulator. The particular
protein structure is thought to be related to ion specificity, specific
recognition of drugs by receptors and to macroscopic phenomena as nerve pulse
propagation. However, lipid membranes in their chain melting regime are known
to be highly permeable to ions, water and small molecules, and are therefore
not always inert. In voltage-clamp experiments one finds quantized conduction
events through protein-free membranes in their melting regime similar to or
even undistinguishable from those attributed to proteins. This constitutes a
conceptual problem for the interpretation of electrophysiological data obtained
from biological membrane preparations. Here, we review the experimental
evidence for lipid ion channels, their properties and the physical chemistry
underlying their creation. We introduce into the thermodynamic theory of
membrane fluctuations from which the lipid channels originate. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the appearance of lipid channels can be influenced by the
alteration of the thermodynamic variables (temperature, pressure, tension,
chemical potentials) in a coherent description that is free of parameters. This
description leads to pores that display dwell times closely coupled to the
fluctuation lifetime via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Drugs as
anesthetics and neurotransmitters are shown to influence the channel likelihood
and their lifetimes in a predictable manner. We also discuss the role of

construction of a data-based prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key
technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within

representations. Traditionally, data representations were hand-crafted.
Recently it has been demonstrated that, given sufficient data, deep neural
networks can learn effective implicit representations from simple input
representations. However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep
learning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or
the output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems
do have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes
them amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems
simultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning
approach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of
data. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data
representation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation
based on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This
transformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate

functional quantum atomistic model for single layer stratum corneum (SC) in
order to contribute to unveil the molecular interactions behind the skin
properties at this scale. The molecular structure of SC was modeled by an
archetype of its hygroscopic proteic portion inside of the corneocytes, the
natural moisturizing factor (NMF), coupled to glycerol molecules which
represent the lipid fraction of SC. The vibrational spectra was calculated and
compared to Fourier-Transform Infrared Absorption spectroscopy (FTIR)
experimental data obtained on animal model of SC. We noticed that bands in the
fingerprint region (800-1800 cm$^{-1}$) were correctly assigned. Moreover, our
calculations revealed the existence of two coupled vibration between hydroxyl
group of lipid and NMF methylene (1120 and 1160 cm$^{-1}$), which are of
special interest since they probe the lipid-amino acid coupling. The model was
also able to predict the shear modulus of dry SC in excellent agreement with
the reported value on literature. Others physical/chemical properties could be
calculated exploring the chemical accuracy and molecular resolution of our

delivery. However, the exact contribution of hyaluronan to tissue penetrability
is poorly understood due to the complex structure and molecular composition of

show that addition of collagen, the other major biopolymer in tissues, causes
the emergence of caged particle dynamics, which is not present in the

noise sources captured simultaneously with biological signals while using
wide-field microscopes can obfuscate fine microtubule structures. Such

effect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental
variables. Mendelian randomization analyses which use variants from a single
genetic region (cis-MR) have gained popularity for being an economical way to
provide supporting evidence for drug target validation. This paper proposes
methods for cis-MR inference which use the explanatory power of many correlated
variants to make valid inferences even in situations where those variants only
have weak effects on the exposure. In particular, we exploit the highly
structured nature of genetic correlations in single gene regions to reduce the
dimension of genetic variants using factor analysis. These genetic factors are
then used as instrumental variables to construct tests for the causal effect of
interest. Since these factors may often be weakly associated with the exposure,
size distortions of standard t-tests can be severe. Therefore, we consider two
approaches based on conditional testing. First, we extend results of
commonly-used identification-robust tests to account for the use of estimated
factors as instruments. Secondly, we propose a test which appropriately adjusts
for first-stage screening of genetic factors based on their relevance. Our
empirical results provide genetic evidence to validate cholesterol-lowering

two computational schemes that can potentially solve this problem. We consider
systems of poorly soluble drug compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide.
Considering that the biggest contribution among all inter-molecular

particles as coarse-grained ones interacting via the effective Lennard-Jones
potential. The first proposed approach is based on the classical density
functional theory and the second one relies on molecular dynamics simulation of
the Lennard-Jones fluid. Sacrificing the precision of the molecular structure
description while capturing the phase behavior of the fluid with sufficient
accuracy, we propose computationally advantageous paths to obtaining the
solvation free energy values with the accuracy satisfactory for engineering
applications. The agreement reached between the results of such coarse-graining
models and the experimental data indicates that the use of the all-atom

well-posed for this predictive modeling challenge, efforts to date have
primarily aimed to increase activity against a single known substrate, rather
than to identify enzymes capable of acting on new substrates of interest. To
address this need, we curate 6 different high-quality enzyme family screens
from the literature that each measure multiple enzymes against multiple
substrates. We compare machine learning-based compound-protein interaction
(CPI) modeling approaches from the literature used for predicting drug-target
interactions. Surprisingly, comparing these interaction-based models against
collections of independent (single task) enzyme-only or substrate-only models
reveals that current CPI approaches are incapable of learning interactions
between compounds and proteins in the current family level data regime. We
further validate this observation by demonstrating that our no-interaction
baseline can outperform CPI-based models from the literature used to guide the
discovery of kinase inhibitors. Given the high performance of non-interaction

equations of mixture theory to describe the behavior of the interstitial fluid

procedure, a medical person takes a big pinch of the skin of the injection

operationalised via multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) scores. The
procedure is based on a suitable model to accommodate key features of the data,
which are typically of mixed type and potentially depended, with factor models
providing a standard choice. The contribution of this paper is threefold:
first, we extend the family of existing structured factor models. Second, we
provide a framework for choosing between them, which combines fit and
out-of-sample predictive performance. Third, we present a sequential estimation
framework that can offer multiple benefits: (i) it allows us to efficiently
re-estimate MCDA scores of different drugs each time new data become available,
thus getting an idea on potential fluctuations in differences between them,
(ii) it can provide information on potential early stopping in cases of evident
conclusions, thus reducing unnecessary further exposure to undesirable
treatments; (iii) it can potentially allow to assign treatment groups
dynamically based on research objectives. A drawback of sequential estimation
is the increased computational time, but this can be mitigated by efficient
sequential Monte Carlo schemes which we tailor in this paper to the context of
Bayesian benefit risk analysis. The developed methodology is illustrated on

including compound representation and model interpretability. While atom-level
molecular graph representations are commonly used because of their ability to
capture natural topology, they may not fully express important substructures or
functional groups which significantly influence molecular properties.
Consequently, recent research proposes alternative representations employing
reduction techniques to integrate higher-level information and leverages both
representations for model learning. However, there is still a lack of study
about different molecular graph representations on model learning and
interpretation. Interpretability is also crucial for drug discovery as it can
offer chemical insights and inspiration for optimization. Numerous studies
attempt to include model interpretation to explain the rationale behind
predictions, but most of them focus solely on individual prediction with little
analysis of the interpretation on different molecular graph representations.
This research introduces multiple molecular graph representations that
incorporate higher-level information and investigates their effects on model
learning and interpretation from diverse perspectives. The results indicate
that combining atom graph representation with reduced molecular graph
representation can yield promising model performance. Furthermore, the
interpretation results can provide significant features and potential
substructures consistently aligning with background knowledge. These multiple
molecular graph representations and interpretation analysis can bolster model
comprehension and facilitate relevant applications in drug discovery."

Without these constraints, the generated conformations may not be suitable for

target node features. To capture non-covalent interactions, we introduce
ligand-target compound inter and intra edges. To further improve the biological
relevance of the generated conformations, we train energy models using scalar

Diffusion Probabilistic Models, resulting in more biologically meaningful

can surpass more complex ones in specific tasks, while 3D models leveraging
structural information become increasingly competitive with larger training
datasets containing compounds with labelled affinity data against multiple

demonstrate significant advantages in data-scarce scenarios for specific

Identification of TCM targets is essential to elucidate the chemical basis and

both in silico high-throughput drug-target interaction predicting models and
biological profile-based methods have been commonly applied for identifying TCM
targets based on the structural information of TCM chemical components and
biological information, respectively. However, the existing methods lack the
integration of TCM chemical and biological information, resulting in difficulty
in the systematic discovery of TCM action pathways. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM
target path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First,
NP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between
drug/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures
for 8,233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary
classification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally,
we can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect
targets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal
components-direct targets-indirect targets by mapping TCM targets in the
biological molecular network. We apply NP-TCMtarget to the formula XiaoKeAn to
demonstrate the power of revealing the action pathways of herbal formula. We
expect that this novel model could provide a systematic framework for exploring
the molecular mechanisms of TCM at the target level. NP-TCMtarget is available

work, we focus on the two-label learning task, and propose a novel training and
inference framework, Dual-Label Learning (DLL). The DLL framework formulates
the problem into a dual-function system, in which the two functions should
simultaneously satisfy standard supervision, structural duality and

explicitly captures the information exchange between labels, aimed at
maximizing the utility of partially available labels in understanding label

as part of the forward propagation process, while during inference, labels are
regarded as unknowns of a bivariate system of equations and are solved jointly.
Theoretical analysis guarantees the feasibility of DLL, and extensive

permeability. Following Lipinski's rule of five, logP was identified as one of
the key determinants of the stability of chemical entities and, as such, needed
state-of-the-art methods for measuring lipophilicity. This paper presents a

was prepared to contain a wide range of chemical structures with differing

conducted using the Keras Tuner alongside the Hyperband algorithm to enhance
the performance. OWPCP demonstrated outstanding performance compared to current
computational methods, achieving an MAE=0.247 on the test set and outperforming
all previous DL models. Remarkably, while one of the most accurate recent

complex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated
graphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they
should not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation
impossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an
atom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can
involve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the
maximal length of a cycle can be bounded.
  Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods
based on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These
approaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the
maximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem,
we propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key
novel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide
short-cuts for long-range dependencies.
  We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and
2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the
generated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite,
which evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their
lipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show
that the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that
are accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the ""Infernal""

functional cure for HIV-1 remains a significant challenge since the viruses are
able to evade immune clearance, which in turn enables post-treatment viral
rebound. Because traditional deterministic models assume a constant
reactivation rate, they fail to capture the stochastic nature of latency
reversal influenced by immune perturbations and ART pharmacokinetics. Thus, in
this study, by using a Poisson-driven stochastic framework that incorporates
fluctuations in activation rates, we study viral rebound dynamics. Via an
exponentially decreasing drug washout model, we accurately quantifies the
nonlinear interplay between ART decay and stochastic reactivation, improving
the theoretical estimates of post-treatment control. Beyond the introduction of
stochasticity, our model establishes a time-dependent viral reactivation
framework that integrates periodic and random perturbations in the activation
rates. Unlike conventional models that assume uniform (temporally independent
reactivation), we show that latency reversal follows structured oscillatory
patterns modulated by immune cycles, circadian rhythms, and transient
inflammatory episodes. This finding suggests that viral rebound risk is
dynamically shaped by immune fluctuations, contrary to the assumption of a
constant reactivation probability. We also study the model system by
incorporating Gamma-distributed waiting times to account for heterogeneity in
reactivation kinetics, which in turn provides a more flexible characterization
of reservoir dynamics. We believe that these insights have critical

typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and

and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and often lack
mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address
these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing
Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, the Hierarchical

representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via
hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to
effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and
task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such
as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). We systematically evaluate HimNet
on eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and
three challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria

pharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property

molecule, is ranked top among the most difficult and attractive problems in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Its importance comes from the
relationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or
RNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are
usually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no
shortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many
physical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to
their large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.
  In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance
in computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the
sequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical
models and machine learning methods. The success of computational methods is
highly dependent on a large database of the proteins and RNA with known
structures.
  However, the performance of computational methods are always expected to be
improved. There are several reasons for this. First, we are facing, and will
continue to face sparseness of data.Secondly, the 3D structure space is too
large for our computational capability.
  The two obstacles can be removed by knowledge-based methods, which combine
knowledge learned from the known structures and biologists' knowledge of the
folding process of protein or RNA. In the dissertation, I will present my
results in building a knowledge-based method by using machine learning methods
to tackle this problem. My methods include the knowledge constraints on
intermediate states, which can highly reduce the solution space of a protein or
RNA, in turn increasing the efficiency of the structure folding method and
improving its accuracy."

their networks only extract features from a fix-sized subgraph structure (i.e.,
a fix-sized receptive field) of each node, and ignore features in substructures

understood how nontrivial interparticle interactions in a finite $N$-body
system influence resultant structure, and how that structure depends on $N$. In
this study, we investigate the emergence of non-close packings using multi-well
isotropic pair potentials to simulate finite cluster formation of four distinct
two-dimensional crystal structures. These pair potentials encode multiple
preferred length scales into the system, allowing us to understand how
anisotropic structural motifs -- as opposed to close-packing -- emerge as
cluster size $N$ increases. We find a tendency toward close-packing at small
system sizes irrespective of the bulk structure; however, the system size at
which bulk structure emerges is influenced by the coordination number of the
bulk and the shape of the pair potential. Anisotropic structure emerges through
the formation of bonds at a secondary bonding length at larger system sizes,
and it is also dependent upon the shape of the pair potential. Our findings
demonstrate that tuning particle-particle interactions can enable the
engineering of nano- or mesoscale soft matter clusters, in applications as

use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space,
conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion
models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of
atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering
the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly
consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the
ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free
energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial
metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand
and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity
Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance
method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand
binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between
ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to
model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina
(ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity
based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By
using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient
of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained
diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of
generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly

we first discuss the identifiability of causal structures. Next we present a

  We consider a variation of the problem of high practical relevance, where the
rings of molecules must not be broken, i.e., the block and bridge structure of
the input graphs must be retained by the common subgraph. We present an
algorithm for finding a maximum common connected induced subgraph of two given

$\mathcal{O}(\Delta n^2)$ in outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices with maximum

important task. Deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs)
offer a potential solution by designing descriptors as probabilistic latent
vectors derived from molecular structures. These models can be trained on large

processes where two or more proteins physically bind together to achieve their
functions. Modeling PPIs is useful for many biomedical applications, such as
vaccine design, antibody therapeutics, and peptide drug discovery. Pre-training
a protein model to learn effective representation is critical for PPIs. Most
pre-training models for PPIs are sequence-based, which naively adopt the
language models used in natural language processing to amino acid sequences.
More advanced works utilize the structure-aware pre-training technique, taking
advantage of the contact maps of known protein structures. However, neither
sequences nor contact maps can fully characterize structures and functions of
the proteins, which are closely related to the PPI problem. Inspired by this
insight, we propose a multimodal protein pre-training model with three
modalities: sequence, structure, and function (S2F). Notably, instead of using
contact maps to learn the amino acid-level rigid structures, we encode the
structure feature with the topology complex of point clouds of heavy atoms. It
allows our model to learn structural information about not only the backbones
but also the side chains. Moreover, our model incorporates the knowledge from

certain objectives, such as quantitative estimates of the drug-likeness score
(QEDs), is NP-hard due to the vast combinatorial design space of discrete
molecular structures, which makes it near impossible to explore the entire
search space comprehensively to exploit de novo structures with properties of
interest. To address this challenge, reducing the intractable search space into
a lower-dimensional latent volume helps examine molecular candidates more
feasibly via inverse design. Autoencoders are suitable deep learning
techniques, equipped with an encoder that reduces the discrete molecular
structure into a latent space and a decoder that inverts the search space back
to the molecular design. The continuous property of the latent space, which
characterizes the discrete chemical structures, provides a flexible
representation for inverse design in order to discover novel molecules.
However, exploring this latent space requires certain insights to generate new
structures. We propose using a convex hall surrounding the top molecules in
terms of high QEDs to ensnare a tight subspace in the latent representation as
an efficient way to reveal novel molecules with high QEDs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our suggested method by using the QM9 as a training dataset
along with the Self- Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) representation to
calibrate the autoencoder in order to carry out the Inverse molecular design

Among the existing methods for evaluating multimer structures, DockQ is the
most commonly used. However, as a more suitable metric for complex docking,
DockQ cannot provide a unique and accurate evaluation in the non-docking

to DockQ in the evaluation accuracy according to CAPRI classification, and is
able to handle the non-docking situation better than DockQ. Besides, we
calculated DCI score on CASP datasets and compared it with CASP official

alignment-free methods, which represent protein structures as fixed-length
real-valued vectors, are proposed for PSSS. Although these methods have lower

POSH learns a binary vector representation for each protein structure, which
can dramatically reduce the time and memory cost for PSSS compared with
real-valued vector representation based methods. Furthermore, in POSH we also
propose expressive hand-crafted features and a structure encoder to well model
both node and edge interactions in proteins. Experimental results on real

Protein classification, which is typically done through measuring the

information, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein
function and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic
topology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a
variety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores
the potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein
classification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint
based support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct
machine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints,
which are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To
validate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems.
First, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of
influenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and
unbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the
classification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and
obtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and
alpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins.
We have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the

models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an
activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound
behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods
exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's
personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since
the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact
leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by
the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to

cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few

describe a node's importance by its position in a network. The key issue
obviated is that the contribution of a node to the collective behavior is not
uniquely determined by the structure of the system but it is a result of the
interplay between dynamics and network structure. We show that dynamical

infectious disease propagation. Our central hypothesis is that the observed
racial disparities in incarceration rates between Black and White Americans can
be explained as the result of differential sentencing between the two
demographic groups. We demonstrate that if incarceration can be spread through
a social influence network, then even relatively small differences in
sentencing can result in the large disparities in incarceration rates.
Controlling for effects of transmissibility, susceptibility, and influence
network structure, our model reproduces the observed large disparities in
incarceration rates given the differences in sentence lengths for White and
Black drug offenders in the United States without extensive parameter tuning.
We further establish the suitability of the SIS model as applied to
incarceration, as the observed structural patterns of recidivism are an
emergent property of the model. In fact, our model shows a remarkably close
correspondence with California incarceration data, without requiring any
parameter tuning. This work advances efforts to combine the theories and
methods of epidemiology and criminology."

and interfacial tension. We show that as the particle amphiphilicity increases
due to enhanced wetting of each side with its favorite fluid, the rotational
thermal motion decreases. Moreover, the in-plane diffusion of nanoparticles at
the interface becomes slower for more amphiphilic particles, mainly due to
formation of a denser adsorption layer. The particles induce an ordered
structure in the surrounding fluid that becomes more pronounced for highly
amphiphilic nanoparticles, leading to increased resistance against nanoparticle
motion. A similar phenomenon is observed for homogeneous particles diffusing in
bulk upon increasing their wettability. Our findings can provide fundamental
insight into the dynamics of drugs and protein molecules with anisotropic

particle focusing in dead-end structures is achieved under steady-state

the particles are trapped at a flow recirculation region within the grooves due
to a combination of diffusiophoresis transport and hydrodynamic effects.
Counterintuitively, the particle velocity at the focusing point is not
vanishing and, hence, the particles are continuously transported in and out of
the focusing point. The accumulation process is also reversible and one can
cyclically trap and release the colloids by controlling the salt concentration
of the streams via a flow switching valve."

evolution. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark of applying reinforcement
learning to RNA sequence design, in which the objective function is defined to
be the free energy in the sequence's secondary structure. In addition to
experimenting with the vanilla implementations of each reinforcement learning
algorithm from standard libraries, we analyze variants of each algorithm in
which we modify the algorithm's reward function and tune the model's
hyperparameters. We show results of the ablation analysis that we do for these
algorithms, as well as graphs indicating the algorithm's performance across
batches and its ability to search the possible space of RNA sequences. We find
that our DQN algorithm performs by far the best in this setting, contrasting
with, in which PPO performs the best among all tested algorithms. Our results
should be of interest to those in the biomolecular design community and should
serve as a baseline for future experiments involving machine learning in
molecule design."

employing these approaches, we sought to gain deeper insights into the
structural organization and interconnections present within the Omicron virus

including drug delivery, vaccination and diagnostics. These technologies
require control over the distinct particle morphologies that protein
nanocontainers can adopt during self-assembly from their constituent protein
components. The geometric construction principle of virus-derived protein cages
is by now fairly well understood by analogy to viral protein shells in terms of
Caspar and Klug's quasi-equivalence principle. However, many artificial, or
genetically modified, protein containers violate this principle, because
identical protein subunits do not interact in quasi-equivalent ways, leading to
gaps in the particle surface. We introduce a method that exploits information
on the local interactions between the assembly units, called capsomers, to
infer the geometric construction principle of these nanoparticle architectures.
The predictive power of this approach is demonstrated here for a prominent
system in nanotechnology, the AaLS pentamer. Our method not only rationalises
hitherto discovered cage structures, but also predicts geometrically viable
options that have not yet been observed. The classification of nanoparticle
architecture based on the geometric properties of the interaction network
closes a gap in our current understanding of protein container structure and
can be widely applied in protein nanotechnology, paving the way to programmable
control over particle polymorphism."

  Prediction with 3D Information",2023-09-28T10:05:37Z,"Taojie Kuang, Yiming Ren, Zhixiang Ren",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17366v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17366v3,No journal ref found,No comment found,"Molecular property prediction, crucial for early drug candidate screening and
optimization, has seen advancements with deep learning-based methods. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced considerably, they often fall short
in fully leveraging 3D spatial information. Specifically, current molecular
encoding techniques tend to inadequately extract spatial information, leading
to ambiguous representations where a single one might represent multiple
distinct molecules. Moreover, existing molecular modeling methods focus
predominantly on the most stable 3D conformations, neglecting other viable
conformations present in reality. To address these issues, we propose 3D-Mol, a
novel approach designed for more accurate spatial structure representation. It
deconstructs molecules into three hierarchical graphs to better extract
geometric information. Additionally, 3D-Mol leverages contrastive learning for
pretraining on 20 million unlabeled data, treating their conformations with
identical topological structures as weighted positive pairs and contrasting
ones as negatives, based on the similarity of their 3D conformation descriptors
and fingerprints. We compare 3D-Mol with various state-of-the-art baselines on
7 benchmarks and demonstrate our outstanding performance."

propose $\mathbf{BioT5}$, a comprehensive pre-training framework that enriches

$\mathbf{BioT5}$ distinguishes between structured and unstructured knowledge,
leading to more effective utilization of information. After fine-tuning, BioT5
shows superior performance across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating its

Our first method, analyzing the graphical structures of chemical compounds
using embedding data, employs vector search to meet our threshold value. The
results yielded pronounced, concentrated clusters, and the method produced
favorable results in querying and understanding the compounds. We also used
natural language description embeddings stored in a vector database with
GPT3.5, which outperforms the base model. Thus, we introduce a similarity

molecules, enhancing efficiency in chemical exploration and enabling future
development of emergent properties in molecular property prediction models."

  overlap with arXiv:2211.03808","In this study, we present a novel molecular fingerprint generation method
based on multiparameter persistent homology. This approach reveals the latent
structures and relationships within molecular geometry, and detects topological
features that exhibit persistence across multiple scales along multiple
parameters, such as atomic mass, partial charge, and bond type, and can be
further enhanced by incorporating additional parameters like ionization energy,
electron affinity, chirality and orbital hybridization. The proposed
fingerprinting method provides fresh perspectives on molecular structure that
are not easily discernible from single-parameter or single-scale analysis.
Besides, in comparison with traditional graph neural networks, multiparameter
persistent homology has the advantage of providing a more comprehensive and
interpretable characterization of the topology of the molecular data. We have
established theoretical stability guarantees for multiparameter persistent
homology, and have conducted extensive experiments on the Lipophilicity,
FreeSolv, and ESOL datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting
molecular properties."

drug discovery. Previous deep learning approaches have shown promising results
over traditional computationally intensive methods, but resulting in poor
generalization due to limited supervised data. In this paper, we propose to
learn protein-ligand binding representation in a self-supervised learning
manner. Different from existing pre-training approaches which treat proteins
and ligands individually, we emphasize to discern the intricate binding
patterns from fine-grained interactions. Specifically, this self-supervised
learning problem is formulated as a prediction of the conclusive binding
complex structure given a pocket and ligand with a Transformer based
interaction module, which naturally emulates the binding process. To ensure the
representation of rich binding information, we introduce two pre-training
tasks, i.e.~atomic pairwise distance map prediction and mask ligand
reconstruction, which comprehensively model the fine-grained interactions from
both structure and feature space. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of our method across various binding tasks, including
protein-ligand affinity prediction, virtual screening and protein-ligand
docking."
