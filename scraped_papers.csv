carbonate. Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which
are columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of
nanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells
collected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved
and particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea
shells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly
microspheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments
were conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into
the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of
drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in
drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent
ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro
drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM
images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The
sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be
useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and
39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)
was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was
released slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic
polymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a
potential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages."

pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Many existing computational
drug repurposing methods rely on preclinical data (e.g., chemical structures,
drug targets), resulting in translational problems for clinical trials. In this
study, we propose a clinical connectivity map framework for drug repurposing by
leveraging laboratory tests to analyze complementarity between drugs and
diseases. We establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory test
associations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a
longitudinal electronic health record data. We establish clinical disease sign
vectors (i.e., disease-laboratory test associations) by applying a Wilcoxon
rank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Finally, we compute a
repurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair by applying a dot
product-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical
drug effect vectors. We comprehensively evaluate 392 drugs for 6 important
chronic diseases (e.g., asthma, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.).
We discover not only known associations between diseases and drugs but also
many hidden drug-disease associations. Moreover, we are able to explain the
predicted drug-disease associations via the corresponding complementarity
between laboratory tests of drug effect vectors and disease sign vectors. The
proposed clinical connectivity map framework uses laboratory tests from
electronic clinical information to bridge drugs and diseases, which is
explainable and has better translational power than existing computational
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework and suggest that our method could help identify drug repurposing
opportunities, which will benefit patients by offering more effective and safer
treatments."

biological and pharmacological data provide new ways to accelerate drug-target

low-dimensional features for drugs and target proteins by integrating four drug

interaction information between drug and target representations by a mutual
attention network to improve drug-target prediction. DrugMAN achieves the best
prediction performance under four different scenarios, especially in real-world

condition, is common in patients managing multiple or complex conditions.
However, as more drugs are added to the treatment plan, the risk of adverse

polypharmacy only become known after the drugs are in use. It is impractical to
test every possible drug combination during clinical trials. This issue is
particularly prevalent among older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
where polypharmacy and ADEs are commonly observed. In this research, our
primary objective was to identify key drug features to build and evaluate a

model on a domain-specific case study. We developed a two-layer neural network
that incorporated drug features such as molecular structure, drug-protein
interactions, and mono drug side effects (DrIVeNN). We assessed DrIVeNN using
publicly available side effect databases and determined Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) with a variance threshold of 0.95 as the most effective feature

Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH

With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased, and the side phase
fraction decreased. Using 1 H-13 C, 13 C-27 Al HETCOR NMR in combination with

understated. With the sheer volume of potentially useful compounds that are

investigate the overlapping interactions between drugs. Understanding this is
also important to the layperson who needs to know what they can and cannot mix,
especially for those who use recreational drugs - which do not have the same
rigorous warnings as prescription drugs. Without access to deterministic,
experimental results for every drug combination, other methods are necessary to
bridge this knowledge gap. Ideally, such a method would require minimal inputs,

model that meets all these criteria. To this end, we propose a minimal-input
multi-layer perceptron that predicts the interactions between two drugs. This
model has a great advantage of requiring no structural knowledge of the

methods begin by constructing a multi-relational DDI graph and then learning
relation-aware graph structure embeddings (RaGSEs) of drugs from the DDI graph.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches are usually limited in learning RaGSEs
of new drugs, leading to serious over-fitting when the test DDIs involve such
drugs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel DDI prediction method based
on relation-aware graph structure embedding with co-contrastive learning,
RaGSECo. The proposed RaGSECo constructs two heterogeneous drug graphs: a
multi-relational DDI graph and a multi-attribute drug-drug similarity (DDS)
graph. The two graphs are used respectively for learning and propagating the
RaGSEs of drugs, aiming to ensure all drugs, including new ones, can possess
effective RaGSEs. Additionally, we present a novel co-contrastive learning
module to learn drug-pairs (DPs) representations. This mechanism learns DP
representations from two distinct views (interaction and similarity views) and
encourages these views to supervise each other collaboratively to obtain more
discriminative DP representations. We evaluate the effectiveness of our RaGSECo
on three different tasks using two real datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that RaGSECo outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction

focused on the development of highly selective single-target drugs. Nowadays

There are several approaches to discover new drugs targets, as analysis of
genome wide association, gene expression data and networks, structural
approaches with alignment methods etc. Computational drug discovery and design
has experienced a rapid increase in development which is mainly due to the
increasing cost for discovering new compounds. Since drug development is a very
costly venture, the pharmaceutical industry puts effort in the repositioning of
withdrawn or already approved drugs. The costs for bringing such a drug to

one billion US dollars. Thus, target prediction, drug repositioning approaches,

Integrating the functional aspect of these drugs at the genetic level can

GramSeq-DTA, which integrates chemical perturbation information with the
structural information of drugs and targets. We applied a Grammar Variational

from the L1000 project, which provides information on the upregulation and
downregulation of genes caused by selected drugs. This chemical perturbation
information is processed, and a compact dataset is prepared, serving as the
functional feature set of the drugs. By integrating the drug, gene, and target

magnetic Zn0.3Fe0.6O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method in
the presence of citric acid as a reducing agent. In order to reduce the amount
of impurity and obtain the pure spinel phase and reduce the size of magnetic
nanoparticles, the hydrothermal process was carried out in the presence of
different concentrations of the reducing agent and pH level of the medium. The
structural investigations of the resulting nanoparticles were carried out by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results
showed that in order to obtain pure and single-phase spinel nanoparticles with
appropriate particle size and size distribution, it is necessary to control the

expand by killing other cells. Novel cytotoxic drugs and molecularly targeted
drugs are commonly administered as part of cancer therapy. Both types of drugs

The model incorporates resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted drugs. In both
cases, the level of drug resistance is assumed to be a continuous variable
ranging from fully-sensitive to fully-resistant. Using our model we demonstrate
that when the competition is moderate, therapies using both drugs are more
effective compared with single drug therapies. However, when cancer cells are

therapies that are initiated with a targeted drug and are exposed to it for a

  In this work, we present a novel REcursive Prediction (REP) framework for

exploits the intrinsic time-course nature of the data and integrates past

tensor completion that can not only alleviate the impact of noise and missing

better understand the relationship between drug chemistry and DDI. Experimental

predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of
anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II
diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It
identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts
resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with
the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by
integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid
leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy

Specifically, weighted snapshot sequences for dynamic heterogeneous networks

networks are jointly trained to gain both structural correlations in diverse
medical events and temporal dependency in historical health conditions, for
achieving comprehensive patient representations with both semantic features and

adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in internal view of drug molecule

available to obtain high-quality medication combination recommendation.
Finally, extensive experiments on real world datasets are conducted for

existing computational approaches achieve inspiring results, they ignore that
the action of a drug is mainly caused by its chemical substructures. In

supposing that the interactions between two given drugs are caused by their
local chemical structures (sub-structures) and their DDI types are determined
by the linkages between different substructure sets, we design a novel
Substructure-ware Tensor Neural Network model for DDI prediction (STNN-DDI).
The proposed model learns a 3-D tensor of (substructure, in-teraction type,
substructure) triplets, which characterizes a substructure-substructure
interaction (SSI) space. According to a list of predefined substructures with
specific chemical meanings, the mapping of drugs into this SSI space enables
STNN-DDI to perform the multiple-type DDI prediction in both transductive and
inductive scenarios in a unified form with an explicable manner. The
compar-ison with deep learning-based state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates
the superiority of STNN-DDI with the significant improvement of AUC, AUPR,
Accuracy, and Precision. More importantly, case studies illustrate its
interpretability by both revealing a crucial sub-structure pair across drugs
regarding a DDI type of interest and uncovering interaction type-specific
substructure pairs in a given DDI. In summary, STNN-DDI provides an effective

disease, drug, and protein. Analysis of the post-learning features showed that
node types that were not known to the model beforehand are distinguished

weights and features, GraphIX then predicts the disease-drug association and
calculates the contribution values of the nodes located in the neighborhood of
the predicted disease and drug. We hypothesized that the neighboring protein
node to which the model gave a high contribution is important in understanding
the actual pharmacological effects. Quantitative evaluation of the validity of
protein nodes' contribution using a real-world database showed that the high
contribution proteins shown by GraphIX are reasonable as a mechanism of drug

  Feedback",2023-05-29T14:43:24Z,"Shengchao Liu, Jiongxiao Wang, Yijin Yang, Chengpeng Wang, Ling Liu, Hongyu Guo, Chaowei Xiao",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18090v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18090v1,No journal ref found,No comment found,"Recent advancements in conversational large language models (LLMs), such as
ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable promise in various domains, including
drug discovery. However, existing works mainly focus on investigating the
capabilities of conversational LLMs on chemical reaction and retrosynthesis.
While drug editing, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, remains
largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ChatDrug, a framework to
facilitate the systematic investigation of drug editing using LLMs. ChatDrug
jointly leverages a prompt module, a retrieval and domain feedback (ReDF)
module, and a conversation module to streamline effective drug editing. We
empirically show that ChatDrug reaches the best performance on 33 out of 39
drug editing tasks, encompassing small molecules, peptides, and proteins. We
further demonstrate, through 10 case studies, that ChatDrug can successfully
identify the key substructures (e.g., the molecule functional groups, peptide
motifs, and protein structures) for manipulation, generating diverse and valid
suggestions for drug editing. Promisingly, we also show that ChatDrug can offer
insightful explanations from a domain-specific perspective, enhancing
interpretability and enabling informed decision-making. This research sheds
light on the potential of ChatGPT and conversational LLMs for drug editing. It
paves the way for a more efficient and collaborative drug discovery pipeline,
contributing to the advancement of pharmaceutical research and development."

  Drug-Target-Disease Interaction",2023-11-30T20:55:57Z,"Farhan Tanvir, Khaled Mohammed Saifuddin, Tanvir Hossain, Arunkumar Bagavathi, Esra Akbas",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00189v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00189v1,No journal ref found,"13 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables","Modeling the interactions between drugs, targets, and diseases is paramount
in drug discovery and has significant implications for precision medicine and
personalized treatments. Current approaches frequently consider drug-target or
drug-disease interactions individually, ignoring the interdependencies among
all three entities. Within human metabolic systems, drugs interact with protein
targets in cells, influencing target activities and subsequently impacting
biological pathways to promote healthy functions and treat diseases. Moving
beyond binary relationships and exploring tighter triple relationships is
essential to understanding drugs' mechanism of action (MoAs). Moreover,
identifying the heterogeneity of drugs, targets, and diseases, along with their
distinct characteristics, is critical to model these complex interactions
appropriately. To address these challenges, we effectively model the
interconnectedness of all entities in a heterogeneous graph and develop a novel
Heterogeneous Graph Triplet Attention Network (\texttt{HeTriNet}).
\texttt{HeTriNet} introduces a novel triplet attention mechanism within this
heterogeneous graph structure. Beyond pairwise attention as the importance of
an entity for the other one, we define triplet attention to model the
importance of pairs for entities in the drug-target-disease triplet prediction
problem. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that
\texttt{HeTriNet} outperforms several baselines, demonstrating its remarkable
proficiency in uncovering novel drug-target-disease relationships."

from detecting the target structure to obtaining approval from the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and is often riddled with safety concerns. Accurate
prediction of how drugs interact with their targets and the development of new
drugs by using better methods and technologies have immense potential to speed
up this process, ultimately leading to faster delivery of life-saving
medications. Traditional methods used for drug-target interaction prediction
show limitations, particularly in capturing complex relationships between drugs
and their targets. As an outcome, deep learning models have been presented to
overcome the challenges of interaction prediction through their precise and
efficient end results. By outlining promising research avenues and models, each
with a different solution but similar to the problem, this paper aims to give
researchers a better idea of methods for even more accurate and efficient
prediction of drug-target interaction, ultimately accelerating the development
of more effective drugs. A total of 180 prediction methods for drug-target
interactions were analyzed throughout the period spanning 2016 to 2025 using
different frameworks based on machine learning, mainly deep learning and graph
neural networks. Additionally, this paper discusses the novelty, architecture,
and input representation of these models."
